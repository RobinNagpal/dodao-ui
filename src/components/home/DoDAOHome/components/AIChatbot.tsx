                  For blockchain projects, platforms like Discourse and Discord are inundated with new inquiries. Many newcomers hesitate to ask questions,
                  fearing they might appear uninformed. Simultaneously, even long-standing members often struggle to locate specific information.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-8">
                  We have designed an AI chatbot for blockchain projects which can be trained on governance forums and documentation. It can provide accurate
                  information alongwith the links to sources, benefiting both new and experienced users. This AI chatbot is projected to save thousands of hours
                  for community members monthly, showcasing its return on investment (ROI) within just the first month.
