# Use cases for people needing tariff information

## Overview

Tariffs are taxes levied on imported goods and are used to raise government revenue, protect domestic industries and serve as bargaining tools in negotiations[\[1\]](https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/resource/tariffs-101-what-are-they-and-how-do-they-work/#:~:text=Tariffs%20are%20taxes%20imposed%20by,the%20significance%20of%20its%20impacts). Tariffs raise the cost of imported inputs and can reduce the demand for exporters' products[\[2\]](https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/resource/tariffs-101-what-are-they-and-how-do-they-work/#:~:text=Domestic%20industries%20may%20benefit%20from,to%20expand%20and%20increase%20production). The current global trade environment is volatile; the United States raised its average tariff rate to over 20 % in early‑2025, and businesses now face unprecedented uncertainty[\[3\]](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/geopolitics/our-insights/tariffs-and-global-trade-the-economic-impact-on-business#:~:text=Since%20the%20United%20States%E2%80%99%20announcement,White%20House%2C%20April%2010%2C%202025). Supply‑chain surveys show that more than 80 % of supply‑chain leaders report being affected by new tariffs and nearly 30 % see increased material costs or lower demand[\[4\]](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/supply-chain-risk-survey#:~:text=For%202025%2C%20one%20issue%20is,activity%20impacted%20in%20some%20way), while 72 % of trade professionals identify U.S. tariff volatility as the most impactful regulatory change[\[5\]](https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/blog/2026s-supply-chain-challenge-confronting-complexity-and-disruption-in-global-trade-tri/#:~:text=Navigating%20the%20new%20tariff).

Understanding tariff rates and rules of origin therefore matters to a wide spectrum of users-from small e‑commerce sellers trying to estimate landed costs to policy‑makers negotiating free‑trade agreements. The table below identifies common use cases, explains why tariff information is critical, and provides a criticality score (0-100, higher means more critical).

### Top tariff‑information use cases

| #   | Use case | Why tariff info matters (key points) | Criticality score & reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Importers and exporters** | Importers/exporters need to know duty rates to calculate landed cost and remain competitive. Tariffs plus taxes increase the cost to the foreign buyer; knowing the final cost helps price the product and determine competitiveness[\[6\]](https://www.trade.gov/import-tariffs-fees-overview-and-resources#:~:text=governments%20on%20the%20value%20including,to%20quote%20an%20estimate%20of). | **98** - Duty rates directly affect profitability and cash flow; mistakes can lead to penalties or lost customers. |
| **2** | **Supply‑chain managers / procurement teams** | Tariffs influence sourcing strategies and supplier choice; new tariffs raise material costs and disrupt supply chains[\[7\]](https://geodis.com/blog/goods-transportation-integrated-logistics-solutions/how-stay-compliant-us-tariffs-and-reduce#:~:text=The%20landscape%20of%20international%20trade,importing%20into%20the%20United%20States). 82 % of supply‑chain leaders report being affected by tariffs[\[8\]](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/supply-chain-risk-survey#:~:text=For%202025%2C%20one%20issue%20is,activity%20impacted%20in%20some%20way). | **96** - High because supply chains must adjust sourcing, inventory and logistics to manage cost and risk. |
| **3** | **Small businesses & e‑commerce sellers** | SMEs and online sellers must estimate duties for cross‑border sales to avoid surprises for customers. Tariffs and taxes increase landed costs and can erode competitiveness[\[9\]](https://www.trade.gov/import-tariffs-fees-overview-and-resources#:~:text=governments%20on%20the%20value%20including,in%20the%20pro%20forma%20invoice). | **90** - Important for pricing and customer satisfaction; mis‑estimation can deter buyers. |
| **4** | **Logistics providers & freight forwarders** | Brokers and freight forwarders ensure accurate HS classification, manage bonds and duty payments; errors can cause delays. Correct HS codes are essential to avoid over‑payment or penalties[\[10\]](https://geodis.com/blog/goods-transportation-integrated-logistics-solutions/how-stay-compliant-us-tariffs-and-reduce#:~:text=1,Tariff%20Classification%20and%20Duty%20Rate). | **92** - Critical due to legal liability for mis‑classification and need to expedite customs clearance. |
| **5** | **Customs brokers & trade compliance professionals** | Professionals must interpret tariff schedules, rules of origin and duty drawback programs. Tariffs affect inventory costing[\[11\]](https://viewpoint.pwc.com/us/en/pwc/in-depth/id202502.html#:~:text=The%20imposition%20of%20new%20tariffs,results%2C%20liquidity%2C%20and%20financial%20reporting) and may require duty‑drawback procedures[\[12\]](https://viewpoint.pwc.com/us/en/pwc/in-depth/id202502.html#:~:text=Question%201). | **97** - Compliance failures can incur fines; correct tariff knowledge is central to their role. |
| **6** | **Government policy‑makers and trade negotiators** | Governments impose tariffs to raise revenue, protect industries or negotiate[\[1\]](https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/resource/tariffs-101-what-are-they-and-how-do-they-work/#:~:text=Tariffs%20are%20taxes%20imposed%20by,the%20significance%20of%20its%20impacts). Negotiators must assess tariff impacts on domestic industries and evaluate reciprocal tariffs. | **95** - High because tariff decisions affect national economy, trade balance and diplomatic relations. |
| **7** | **Economists and researchers** | They study the macro‑economic effects of tariffs on trade flows and welfare. Tariff data sets such as the WTO's bound and applied duties enable cross‑country comparisons[\[13\]](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tariffs_e/tariff_data_e.htm#:~:text=level,Tariff%20%26%20Trade%20Data%20Platform). | **88** - Important for research but less time‑sensitive than operational roles. |
| **8** | **Investors and financial analysts** | Tariffs affect company earnings, supply chains and market demand; investors need tariff information to assess risk. For example, the 2025 tariff surge caused market volatility[\[3\]](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/geopolitics/our-insights/tariffs-and-global-trade-the-economic-impact-on-business#:~:text=Since%20the%20United%20States%E2%80%99%20announcement,White%20House%2C%20April%2010%2C%202025). | **85** - Important to evaluate investment risk but less directly actionable than for importers. |
| **9** | **Manufacturers & multinationals planning capacity** | Tariffs influence decisions on plant location, sourcing and product design. Manufacturers may shift production to countries with lower tariffs or free‑trade agreements[\[14\]](https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/blog/2026s-supply-chain-challenge-confronting-complexity-and-disruption-in-global-trade-tri/#:~:text=The%20response%20from%20forward,%2851). | **93** - High because misjudging tariffs can lead to stranded assets or uncompetitive pricing. |
| **10** | **Farmers and agribusiness exporters** | Agricultural exports often face tariff‑rate quotas and preferential rates under FTAs. Tariff trackers help determine whether products qualify for duty‑free treatment[\[15\]](https://www.trade.gov/fta-tariff-tool-home#:~:text=This%20free%20search%20tool%20allows,is%20eliminated%20under%20the%20agreement). | **87** - Important for rural incomes and market access; criticality varies by crop. |
| **11** | **Accounting & finance professionals** | Tariffs increase inventory costs and affect capitalized asset values[\[16\]](https://viewpoint.pwc.com/us/en/pwc/in-depth/id202502.html#:~:text=PwC%20response). Accountants must determine whether tariff costs should be capitalized, recognized in revenue or covered by duty‑drawback claims[\[11\]](https://viewpoint.pwc.com/us/en/pwc/in-depth/id202502.html#:~:text=The%20imposition%20of%20new%20tariffs,results%2C%20liquidity%2C%20and%20financial%20reporting). | **92** - High due to financial reporting requirements and potential audit issues. |
| **12** | **Legal advisors & trade lawyers** | They advise clients on tariff classification, compliance, and litigation; tariffs can prompt legal challenges[\[17\]](https://viewpoint.pwc.com/us/en/pwc/in-depth/id202502.html#:~:text=The%20imposition%20of%20new%20tariffs,results%2C%20liquidity%2C%20and%20financial%20reporting). | **90** - Important for advising clients and litigating trade disputes. |
| **13** | **Retail buyers & merchandising teams** | Retailers importing finished goods must factor tariffs into pricing strategies; inability to pass costs on to consumers can compress margins[\[18\]](https://viewpoint.pwc.com/us/en/pwc/in-depth/id202502.html#:~:text=Because%20tariffs%20are%20paid%20by,have%20broader%20ramifications%20for%20the). | **88** - Significant for profit margins and product portfolio decisions. |
| **14** | **Consumer cross‑border shoppers** | Individuals purchasing goods from abroad need to know duties to estimate total cost; de minimis thresholds and tax exemptions vary. | **70** - Moderate; mistakes lead to unexpected costs but do not generally jeopardize livelihoods. |
| **15** | **Students, educators & journalists** | They research tariffs for educational and reporting purposes; need reliable data to explain economic issues. | **65** - Lower criticality; consequences of incorrect data are reputational rather than operational. |
| **16** | **Non‑profits & trade associations** | Industry associations advocate for tariff reductions, collect member data and advise on compliance. Tariffs impact the competitiveness of their members. | **82** - Important for lobbying and supporting members but less time‑critical than operational tasks. |
| **17** | **Data scientists & software developers** | They build tools for tariff simulation, HS classification and trade analytics; require access to clean tariff databases (e.g., WITS, WTO). | **80** - Important for product development but not directly tied to a single transaction. |
| **18** | **Procurement & sourcing consultants** | Consultants help businesses adapt supply chains; they analyze tariff scenarios and recommend sourcing from FTA partners[\[19\]](https://geodis.com/blog/goods-transportation-integrated-logistics-solutions/how-stay-compliant-us-tariffs-and-reduce#:~:text=5,to%20Reduce%20Exposure). | **91** - High because misjudgment could lead to expensive sourcing decisions. |
| **19** | **Travelers shipping personal goods** | People relocating or sending personal effects across borders need to know import duty exemptions or rates. | **65** - Moderate; high if shipping valuable goods. |
| **20** | **Tariff negotiators & compliance trainers** | Professionals teaching tariff compliance and negotiating technical details need comprehensive tariff data and rules of origin. | **89** - Important for training others; errors can propagate through many businesses. |

## Hard‑to‑find or missing tariff information

Although numerous tools exist, users often face information gaps. Five notable missing elements are identified below. Each missing item includes an importance score (> 90 means very important) and a rationale.

| Missing information (problem) | Importance score & reason |
| --- | --- |
| **Real‑time bilateral tariff changes** - Most publicly available databases update annually or quarterly; traders lack up‑to‑the‑minute information on emergency tariff hikes or temporary surcharges. Timely updates are crucial during trade disputes when tariffs can change overnight[\[3\]](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/geopolitics/our-insights/tariffs-and-global-trade-the-economic-impact-on-business#:~:text=Since%20the%20United%20States%E2%80%99%20announcement,White%20House%2C%20April%2010%2C%202025). | **98** - Sudden tariff changes directly affect pricing and supply contracts; delay in information can lead to costly mis‑pricing or shipment delays. |
| **Product‑level rules of origin harmonization** - Rules of origin differ across agreements and countries; many tools provide generic tariff rates but not the detailed criteria needed to determine eligibility. Users must consult multiple sources and interpret legal texts[\[15\]](https://www.trade.gov/fta-tariff-tool-home#:~:text=This%20free%20search%20tool%20allows,is%20eliminated%20under%20the%20agreement). | **96** - Misunderstanding origin rules can result in denied preferential rates, back‑duties or penalties. |
| **Comprehensive multi‑country tariff simulator** - Existing calculators often focus on one country (e.g., U.S.) or a limited set of partners. There is no free, unified tool that allows users to simulate tariffs for any product between any pair of countries including future phase‑outs. | **95** - Businesses sourcing globally need to compare multiple tariff scenarios quickly; lacking a universal simulator hinders strategic planning. |
| **Tariff impacts on services and digital trade** - Most databases focus on goods. As digital services become subject to trade restrictions and digital taxes, there is little accessible data on "tariff‑equivalent" charges for services. | **92** - Service sectors (cloud computing, streaming) need clarity on cross‑border levies; this gap impedes business model planning. |
| **Linkage between tariffs and non‑tariff measures** - Many tools list tariffs but not associated non‑tariff barriers (licensing, sanitary rules). Integrating these measures is complex but necessary to estimate true market access costs[\[35\]](https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/blog/2026s-supply-chain-challenge-confronting-complexity-and-disruption-in-global-trade-tri/#:~:text=The%20cascading%20effects%20include%20not,claims%2C%20and%20more%20frequent%20inspections). | **90** - Non‑tariff measures often have bigger cost impact than tariffs; ignoring them leads to incomplete analysis. |

## Conclusion

Tariff information is critical for a diverse set of users. Importers, exporters and supply‑chain managers require up‑to‑date tariff rates to calculate landed costs and adjust sourcing. Professionals in finance, law and government rely on accurate tariff data to ensure compliance, report financial impacts and negotiate agreements. Despite numerous databases and tools (such as the U.S. FTA Tariff Tool[\[15\]](https://www.trade.gov/fta-tariff-tool-home#:~:text=This%20free%20search%20tool%20allows,is%20eliminated%20under%20the%20agreement), WTO Tariff & Trade Data Platform[\[13\]](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tariffs_e/tariff_data_e.htm#:~:text=level,Tariff%20%26%20Trade%20Data%20Platform) and Flexport's Tariff Simulator[\[24\]](https://tariffs.flexport.com/#:~:text=Navigate%20US%20Tariffs%20with%20Confidence)), users still face information gaps-especially for real‑time changes, product‑level rules of origin, multi‑country simulations, tariffs on services and the integration of non‑tariff measures.

In summary, the report explains that tariffs—taxes on imports—are crucial not only for raising government revenue and protecting domestic industries, but they also directly affect company profitability and supply chain decisions. It identifies 20 top use cases where people need accurate tariff information, ranking them by criticality for roles such as importers, supply-chain managers, legal advisors and policymakers. Each use case includes why tariff knowledge matters and a score reflecting the urgency of this need, with importers/exporters and supply-chain managers topping the list due to direct operational impacts. The report compiles 10 tools and products for each user group—from official databases like the FTA Tariff Tool and WTO Tariff Platform to commercial software and carrier calculators—providing concise descriptions of their functionality. It also highlights five high-importance information gaps, such as the lack of real-time updates and multi-country simulators, underscoring ongoing challenges despite the breadth of existing resources.
