# Insights-UI API Routes & Auth (Stocks, ETFs, Prompts, Prompt Invocations)

Reference for every Next.js API route under `insights-ui/src/app/api/**` that backs the
**stocks**, **stock/ETF scenarios**, **ETFs**, **prompts**, and **prompt-invocation** surfaces of the
KoalaGains UI, together with the auth wrapper each `GET` / `POST` / `PUT` / `DELETE` handler uses.

It exists so that, when adding or reviewing a mutating endpoint, you can confirm at a glance that it
follows the project rule below instead of re-deriving it from the code each time.

## The auth wrappers

All route handlers are wrapped by one of these middlewares (see `src/app/api/helpers/`):

| Wrapper | Meaning | Where used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `withAdminOrToken` | Allows access via **either** an admin JWT login **or** the automation secret (`?token=<AUTOMATION_SECRET>` query param or `x-automation-token` header). | Every admin/automation **mutation** (POST/PUT/DELETE) for stocks, ETFs, prompts, prompt invocations. |
| `withLoggedInAdmin` | Admin JWT only (no token path). | A few **admin-only reads** (GET) that have no automation use case. |
| `withLoggedInUser` | Any logged-in end user. | User-owned data — **favourites** (and notes/lists). Intentionally **not** admin-gated. |
| `withErrorHandlingV2` | No auth. | Public reads (listings, full-render, etc.) **and** machine-to-machine **callbacks / cron triggers** that cannot present an admin token. |

### The rule

> **Every `POST` / `PUT` / `DELETE` for stocks, ETFs, prompts, and prompt invocations must use
> `withAdminOrToken`** — so the admin UI and automation scripts/skills can both call it — **except:**
>
> 1. **Callback routes** — endpoints whose URL is handed to a Lambda / the Python backend so it can
>    POST results or status back. These run unauthenticated (`withErrorHandlingV2`) and must stay that way.
> 2. **Cron / batch routes** — endpoints triggered by a scheduler rather than a human admin.
> 3. **Favourites** (and other user-owned data) — stay on `withLoggedInUser`, exactly as on `main`.

`GET` handlers are out of scope of the rule (mostly public reads); they are listed below for completeness.

Legend: 🔑 `withAdminOrToken` · 🔒 `withLoggedInAdmin` · 👤 `withLoggedInUser` · 🌐 `withErrorHandlingV2` (no auth)

## Excluded by design — Favourites (user-owned)

Favourites are owned by the end user, not by an admin, so they stay on `withLoggedInUser` exactly as on
`main` — they are **not** converted to `withAdminOrToken`.

| Route | Methods | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/[spaceId]/users/favourite-tickers` | GET / POST / PUT | 👤 |
| `/api/[spaceId]/users/favourite-tickers/[favouriteId]` | PUT / DELETE | 👤 |
| `/api/[spaceId]/users/favourite-etfs` | GET / POST | 👤 |
| `/api/[spaceId]/users/favourite-etfs/[favouriteId]` | PUT / DELETE | 👤 |

The same applies to the other user-owned routes under `/api/[spaceId]/users/**` (ticker/ETF notes,
user lists, ticker tags, portfolio-manager profiles).

---

## Summary of the non-`withAdminOrToken` mutations (and why)

| Endpoint | Wrapper | Reason kept as-is |

| `actions/tickers/[tickerKey]/save-matching-attachments-count` | 🌐 | Backend progress callback |
| `actions/tickers/[tickerKey]/save-matching-attachments-processed` | 🌐 | Backend progress callback |

| `etfs-v1/exchange/.../save-report-callback` | 🌐 | Lambda result callback |
| `users/favourite-tickers*`, `users/favourite-etfs*` | 👤 | User-owned data (kept as `main`) |

Everything else that mutates stocks, ETFs, prompts, or prompt invocations is on `withAdminOrToken`.
