We can create a two column layout like Manus and then in the right section we can open an iframe. Most of the tasks can be done in the iframe and the progress can be shown to the user

Flow
- We can first fetch the type of insights(areas) that will be valuable for a ticker
- Each area can have sub-areas
- 


# Prompt
I want to consider a generic report framework which can
- Create reports with some predefined sections like executive summary, conclusion. Some of these reports might have and might not have these sections. For example report of a stock ticker will not have these. Report on a industry sector will have these. Report on tariffs will have some these sections.
- The main sections specific to the report topic will have 3-4 sections and 3-4 subsections under each.
- A section or a sub section many be dependant on any other sections. For example the executive summary and concludion will be dependant on all the main sections and sub sections etc.
- Ability to define, store and choose among multiple report templates (e.g. “Industry Overview,” “Tariff Analysis,” “Company Profile”)each with its own set of optional/pre-required sections and styling.
