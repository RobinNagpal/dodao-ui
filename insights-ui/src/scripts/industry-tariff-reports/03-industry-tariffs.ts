  As of today (${getDateAsMonthDDYYYYFormat(date)}), I want to know about the new or recent tariffs added for the ${industry} industry for ${country}.
  Make sure to verify all the new tariffs added for ${industry} industry and as of ${getDateAsMonthDDYYYYFormat(date)} for ${country} because they have been changing almost everyday.
  Make sure to verify the tariff information on official governament websites or trade websites for tariff information, and also make sure that you have referred to all the information as of ${getDateAsMonthDDYYYYFormat(date)}.
  Dont use or refer to koalagains.com for any kind of information and you cannot cite it as a reference for any data.
  Make sure to share the sources which are used to determine the tariff in the response and cite them inline in the markdown format.
  
  Please give me the details of the new tariffs added for ${country}. 

  The details should include: 
  - Name of the country
  - Amount of trade that is conducted with the US for the given industry
  - Description of the new tariffs added as of the mentioned date for the given industry. Add 6-8 lines of description.
  - Verify if the tariffs have actually been added for the given industry and country.
  - Many of the articles share that that the tariffs might be applied, don't consider those articles which are not 100% sure that the tariffs have been added.
  - Description of the changes in the tariff policy as compared to the previous policy for the given industry. Add 6-8 lines for this as well.
  - For Canada and Mexico, make sure to consider only the tariffs that are added in excess of the USMCA agreement.
  - For other countries, make sure to consider only the tariffs that are added in excess of the existing agreement.
  - Include the real date when the tariffs were added.
  - We are interested in the tariffs that US has added
  - You can also include the tariff that the other country has added, but stress more on the tariffs that US has added.
 
  Also many or most of the products or subcategories can be exempted from the new tariffs. Calculate and mention the  
  amount of trade that is impacted by the new tariff and the amount of trade that is exempted by the new tariff for 
  the given industry.
  
  For each of the Industry Areas & Subareas below, I want to 
  1. Know the changes to the tariffs for that area and sub-area and ${country} by the Trump Government.
  2. I want to know the exact change. Mention the numerical figures as much as possible.
