This article explains how [GAAP standards](https://www.fasb.org/) apply to [Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)](https://www.sec.gov/education/investor-resources/investor-information-center/reits#:~:text=REITs%20are%20companies%20that%20own "What are REITs?"), focusing on **amortization** and **depreciation**. You will learn why these non-cash expenses can cause reported earnings to understate true cash flows, how metrics like **Funds From Operations (FFO)** and **Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)** provide a clearer performance picture, and how REIT-specific accounting differs from other sectors. Finally, we will explore the differences between amortization and depreciation, with practical examples of when each method is used.



## Deep Dive into GAAP and REIT Accounting: Key Insights

This article cuts through the generalities to focus on the distinctive and insightful aspects of how [GAAP](https://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/SectionPage&cid=1176156317989) applies to [REITs](https://www.reit.com/) and how their accounting methods diverge from other sectors.

### GAAP and Its Impact on REIT Financial Reporting
Under [GAAP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp), REITs record their real estate assets at historical cost, including the purchase price, transaction fees, and capitalized improvements. Even as these properties appreciate in market value, they are **depreciated** over extended useful lives (typically 30 to 40 years). This depreciation, a **non-cash expense**, can substantially reduce GAAP-reported net income, leading to a disconnect between reported earnings and the actual cash flows the REIT generates.

#### Key Implications:
- **Depreciation Effects:** The systematic depreciation of buildings dampens GAAP net income. This means that a REIT’s profitability on paper may appear lower than what its cash flows indicate.
- **Cash Flow Disconnect:** Since depreciation does not affect cash movement, investors might overlook a REIT’s true performance if they rely solely on GAAP earnings.

### The Use of Non-GAAP Metrics: FFO and AFFO
To better reflect the underlying economic performance of REITs, industry practitioners supplement GAAP measures with non-GAAP metrics:

- **Funds From Operations (FFO):**
FFO adjusts GAAP net income by adding back depreciation and amortization and removing the impact of property sales gains or losses. This provides a clearer picture of the REIT’s core operational cash flow. [Learn more here](https://www.reit.com/tools-and-resources/reit-fundamentals/what-are-reits).

- **Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO):**
Going a step further, AFFO refines FFO by subtracting recurring capital expenditures and other maintenance-related costs, offering an even closer approximation of sustainable cash flow available for dividend payments.

These adjustments bypass the misleading effects of non-cash accounting measures that can obscure the actual financial health of a REIT.

### Distinctive Features of REIT Accounting Compared to Other Sectors
REITs differ significantly from companies in other sectors in how they are accounted for:

- **Asset Valuation:**
Unlike industries that might periodically revalue assets to reflect current market conditions, REITs stick with historical cost accounting. This results in a gap between the book value of properties and their market value, meaning GAAP net income may not convey the real economic gain in asset appreciation.

- **Dividend Mandate and Cash Flow Focus:**
By law, REITs must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends. As a consequence, the emphasis for investors shifts from GAAP net income to robust cash flow measures. FFO and AFFO become critical for assessing dividend sustainability and overall financial health. [SEC guidelines on REIT distributions](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersreithtm.html) provide additional detail.

- **Non-Cash Expenses:**
The heavy reliance on non-cash expenses like depreciation in REITs contrasts with other sectors where operating expenses more directly impact cash flows. REIT investors must look beyond traditional earnings metrics to understand true operational performance.



## Amortization in REITs
Real Estate Investment Trusts use **amortization** to spread out costs over time. This is vital for both accounting and managing [real estate debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-estate-debt.asp). In REITs, amortization appears in two main forms: one for accounting intangible assets and the other for repaying loans.

### 1. What Is Amortization in REITs?
Amortization is the process of allocating a one-time cost over several years. In REITs, this can refer to:

- **Accounting Amortization:**
Costs for intangible assets, such as in-place leases or deferred financing fees, are spread over their useful lives. Although these charges reduce net income, they do not use cash each year.

- **Debt Amortization:**
This involves paying down the loan principal. Each payment is divided into **interest** (recorded as an expense) and **principal** (which reduces the loan balance)—and the principal payments are real cash outflows.

### 2. Different Types of Amortization in REITs

#### A. Accounting Amortization (Non-Cash Expense)
- **What It Is:**
Spreading out the cost of intangible assets like lease intangibles, deferred financing costs, or leasing commissions over time.

- **Example:**
A REIT pays \$5M in loan fees upfront on a \$100M loan. If spread over 10 years, the annual amortization expense is \$500K. This reduces reported earnings but does not lower cash during later years.

#### B. Debt Principal Amortization (Cash Payment)
- **What It Is:**
Regular payments on a loan that reduce the principal. Each payment consists of interest (expense) and principal (a cash outflow).

- **Example:**
In a 30-year mortgage, monthly payments reduce the loan balance gradually, affecting cash flow but not the income statement directly.

**Comparison Table**

| Type                           | Cash Impact           | Recorded as Expense? | Added Back in FFO? |
|--|--|-|--|
| Accounting Amortization        | No (Non-cash)         | Yes                  | Yes                |
| Debt Principal Amortization    | Yes (Cash Outflow)    | No                   | No                 |

### 3. How Amortization Works in REITs

#### For Accounting Amortization
1. **Acquisition and Capitalization:**
A REIT assigns part of a property’s purchase price to intangible assets (e.g., in-place leases).
2. **Spreading the Expense:**
For instance, if \$3M is assigned to leases over 3 years, \$1M is expensed each year.
3. **Non-Cash Charge:**
The expense is recorded annually even though no additional cash is spent.
4. **Impact on FFO:**
When calculating [Funds From Operations (FFO)](https://www.reit.com/tools-and-resources/glossary/ffo), the non-cash expense is added back to net income.

#### For Debt Amortization
1. **Loan Agreement:**
The REIT borrows money and agrees to regular payments.
2. **Breakdown of Payments:**
Payments include interest (expense) and principal (reduces debt).
3. **Cash Outflow:**
The repayment of the principal is a cash outflow, reducing cash reserves.

### 4. Advantages of Using Amortization in REITs

#### A. Matches Costs with Benefits
- **Explanation:**
It aligns the cost of an asset with the period during which it generates income.
- **Example:**
Amortizing in-place leases over their useful life matches the expense with incoming rental income.

#### B. Reflects True Cash Flow
- **Explanation:**
Because non-cash expenses are added back in FFO, investors get a better sense of actual cash performance.
- **Example:**
Even if net income decreases by \$500K due to amortization, the cash flow remains unaffected.

#### C. Smoother Financial Reporting
- **Explanation:**
Spreading expenses prevents large fluctuations in annual earnings.
- **Example:**
A REIT’s earnings appear more consistent when the cost of assets is amortized over several years.

#### D. Transparency in Debt Management
- **Explanation:**
Differentiating between non-cash accounting charges and actual cash outflows from debt repayment helps investors see how cash is being managed.
- **Example:**
By presenting both amortization expenses and principal repayments, REITs provide clearer financial information.

### Examples of Amortized Items in REITs

Below are 10 examples of items that are often amortized. They reduce reported earnings without immediately affecting the REIT’s cash:

1. **Deferred Loan Fees:**
A fee paid at the start of a loan is recorded as an asset and amortized over the life of the loan.

2. **Lease Incentives:**
Payments made to attract tenants (such as free rent periods) are spread out over the lease term.

3. **In-Place Lease Value:**
The value assigned to a building’s current tenant contracts is amortized over the expected lease life.

4. **Above/Below Market Lease Adjustments:**
Adjustments made because leases are priced differently than current market rates are recorded and amortized.

5. **Loan Discount (Original Issue Discount):**
When a loan is issued at a discount, the difference is amortized over the life of the loan.

6. **Deferred Financing Costs on Refinancing:**
Costs paid during a refinancing are capitalized and then amortized over the new loan’s term.

7. **Leasing Commissions:**
Broker fees for securing tenants are often spread over the length of the tenant’s lease period.

8. **Tenant Improvements (Capitalized):**
Costs for upgrading spaces to meet tenant requirements can be amortized over the lease term.

9. **Software or Licensing Costs:**
When a REIT invests in a new property management system, the cost can be spread out over several years.

10. **Legal and Organizational Fees:**
Certain fees related to setting up financing or the REIT itself may be amortized to show their ongoing impact rather than a one-time hit.



## Depreciation in REITs: A Comprehensive Guide
Real Estate Investment Trusts have unique financial characteristics that set them apart from many other investments. One of these aspects is **depreciation**—a **non-cash expense** that plays a significant role in the accounting and valuation of real estate holdings.

### 1. Understanding Depreciation in the Context of REITs

#### What Is Depreciation?
[Depreciation](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/a-brief-overview-of-depreciation) is the accounting process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its estimated useful life. Although real estate properties often appreciate in market value, the buildings and improvements on the property are expensed over time. In the world of REITs, depreciation:
- **Reduces taxable income** (without a cash outlay).
- **Impacts financial metrics**, making income appear lower than it would if the non-cash expense were not included.

### 2. What Assets Are Subject to Depreciation?
In a REIT, only the portion of the investment considered “depreciable” is subject to this treatment:

| **Asset Type**              | **Depreciated?** | **Examples**                                   |
|--||--|
| **Buildings & Structures**  | Yes              | Apartments, offices, industrial complexes     |
| **Building Improvements**   | Yes              | HVAC systems, roofing, elevator installations |
| **Furniture & Fixtures**    | Yes              | Lobby furniture, security systems, gym equipment |
| **Land**                    | No               | The underlying property (it does not wear out)|

### 3. The Mechanics of Depreciation

#### How Is Depreciation Calculated?
Most REITs use the **straight-line method**. Under the straight-line method, an equal amount of depreciation is charged each year over the asset’s useful life.

> **Annual Depreciation = (Cost of the Asset – Salvage Value) ÷ Useful Life**

For instance, if a REIT acquires a building (excluding the land) for \$39 million with an estimated useful life of 39 years:

> \$39 million ÷ 39 = \$1 million per year in depreciation expense

#### Common Useful Lives under GAAP/IRS
- **Residential Property:** 27.5 years
- **Commercial Property:** 39 years
- **Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment:** 5–15 years

### 4. Realistic Examples in Practice

#### Example 1: Residential Apartment Complex
A REIT acquires three apartment buildings:

| **Property**   | **Purchase Price (Building Portion)** | **Depreciation Life** | **Annual Depreciation** |
|-||--|-|
| **Building A** | \$20 million                          | 27.5 years           | ~\$727,000             |
| **Building B** | \$30 million                          | 27.5 years           | ~\$1.09 million        |
| **Building C** | \$49.5 million                        | 27.5 years           | ~\$1.8 million         |
| **Total**      | \$99.5 million                        |                       | ~\$3.6 million/year    |

Although this reduces GAAP net income by \$3.6 million each year, the actual cash flow from operations is unaffected.

#### Example 2: Commercial Office Building
A REIT purchases an office building for \$50 million, allocating \$10 million to land and \$40 million to the structure, depreciated over 39 years:

> \$40 million ÷ 39 ≈ \$1.03 million per year

Even if the building’s market value appreciates, the reported net income is reduced annually by this depreciation expense.

### 5. Depreciation’s Impact on Financial Statements

#### A. Income Statement
- **Depreciation as an Operating Expense:**
Lowers net income but requires no cash.
*Example:*
- Rental Revenue: \$10 million
- Operating Expenses: \$4 million
- Depreciation Expense: \$2 million
- **Net Income:** \$4 million

#### B. Balance Sheet
- **Asset Book Value:**
The historical cost of the asset is reduced by accumulated depreciation over time.
*Example:*
- Original Cost: \$39 million
- Accumulated Depreciation (3 years): \$3 million
- **Net Book Value:** \$36 million

#### C. Cash Flow Statement
- **Add-Back Provision:**
Because depreciation is non-cash, it’s added back to net income in the operating activities section.
*Example:*
- Net Income: \$4 million
- Add Depreciation: \$2 million
- **Cash Provided by Operations:** \$6 million



## When to Use Depreciation vs. Amortization (With Examples)
Depreciation and amortization are both methods of allocating costs over time, but they apply to different types of assets and have distinct use cases:

1. **Depreciation** applies to **tangible** assets like buildings, furniture, and equipment.
- **Example:** A REIT buys an apartment building for \$30 million. The portion allocated to the structure (say \$25 million) is **depreciated** over 27.5 years.
- **Tip:** Use depreciation when the asset has physical substance and is expected to deteriorate or become obsolete over its useful life.

2. **Amortization** applies to **intangible** assets and certain debt-related costs.
- **Example:** A REIT pays \$2 million in deferred financing fees on a \$50 million loan. Those fees are **amortized** over 10 years.
- **Tip:** Use amortization for intangible items (e.g., in-place leases, software, loan fees) and for structuring periodic principal payments.

**Key Differences**
- **Nature of the Asset:** Physical (depreciation) vs. intangible (amortization).
- **Cash Impact:** Both are often non-cash expenses, although debt amortization can involve real cash outflows.
- **Accounting Treatment:** Both reduce GAAP net income, but non-cash items typically get added back in FFO or AFFO calculations for REITs.
