Below is a practitioner‑oriented map of **six U.S. fund wrappers that digital‑asset and multi‑asset managers actually use in 2025**. For each structure you get the statutory ground‑rules, the exact SEC/OCC forms, the hard filing fees, realistic external‑counsel budgets, the operational pain‑points, and live crypto‑related funds using the vehicle. A 20‑factor matrix at the end lets you benchmark them side‑by‑side.


## Quick take

* **Private Funds (3(c)(1)/(7))** still dominate crypto VC and hedge strategies because you file only a Form D (free) and stay out of the 1940 Act. But you’re capped at 99 “accrediteds” or qualified‑purchaser gating, and new Form PF/quarterly statement rules are biting. 
* The first **’40‑Act spot‑bitcoin ETFs** showed how fast an **Open‑End RIC** can gain assets when custody risk is solved; but legal budgets routinely top US \$750 k between trust‑docs, seed audit and market‑maker arrangements. ([Fidelity Actions Exchange Repository][1])
* **Interval Funds** and **BDC‑style credit funds** are the growth area for tokenised private credit. They register on Form N‑2, pay Securities‑Act fees up‑front and take 4‑6 months to launch. 
* **Collective Investment Trusts (CITs)** give pension‑only exposure to bitcoin at bank‑trust level under OCC Rule 9.18 with no SEC touch‑points—but you need a national‑bank trustee. ([OCC.gov][2])
* Banking remains the chokepoint: Customers Bank’s CBIT network caps crypto deposits at 15 % of totals, while BNY and State Street restrict exposure to fully registered funds. ([CoinDesk][3], [bny.com][4], [State Street][5])

### Private Fund (Investment Company Act §§ 3(c)(1) & 3(c)(7)) — expanded
Below we explain the key features of the Private Fund wrapper, which is the most common structure used by various funds in the digital‑asset space, including crypto hedge funds and venture capital funds.

#### Statutory positioning

Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act exclude a fund from “investment‑company” status if it (a) keeps its investor count below the relevant cap **and** (b) does not hold itself out to the public. 3(c)(1) is the classic hedge‑fund carve‑out; 3(c)(7) was introduced in 1996 to accommodate larger pools aimed solely at **qualified purchasers (QP)**. ([SEC][1])

#### Formation wrapper

Sponsors almost always form a Delaware limited partnership (LP) with a Cayman “master” for non‑U.S. trading and a Delaware or Cayman “feeder” for tax‑blocked ERISA money. That keeps U.S. source‑income in the LP (pass‑through) while giving offshore investors blocker protection.

#### Capital‑raising mechanics

Interests are sold under **Reg D**:

* **Rule 506(b)** – private placement ; no general solicitation; unlimited accredited investors + up to 35 sophisticated non‑accrediteds.
* **Rule 506(c)** – permits internet “blast” marketing but every subscriber’s accredited status must be independently verified. ([Carta][2])
  Blue‑sky “notice” filings run **\$100‑500 per state**. ([sampleprivateplacement.org][3])

#### Investor‑cap options

* **3(c)(1)** – hard limit **99 beneficial owners** (look‑through certain entities) regardless of size.
* **3(c)(7)** – up to **2,000 QPs** (≈ \$5 m+ investable assets natural person / \$25 m entity). Funds frequently run parallel 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) feeders so smaller checks can still come in.

#### Reporting & adviser registration

* **Form D** within 15 days of first sale (no fee).
* **Form ADV** if adviser’s **RAUM > \$110 m**.
* **Form PF** – quarterly for advisers with **private‑fund AUM ≥ \$1.5 bn**; otherwise annual. ([SEC][4])

#### Audit duty & the 2025 Private‑Fund Adviser Rules (PFAR)

Advisers rely on Advisers‑Act Rule 206(4)‑2 (“custody rule”)—annual **GAAP audit** delivered within 120 days of FYE. PFAR now also **mandates**:

* **Quarterly statements** (fees, expenses, performance) to every LP.
* **Side‑letter parity / disclosure**.
  Compliance date: **14 March 2025** for most crypto funds. ([SEC][1])

#### Governance

No statutory board. Governance occurs through the **general‑partner (GP) entity** and, increasingly, an **LP Advisory Committee (LPAC)** that can waive conflicts, approve valuations, or green‑light side pockets.

#### Fees & budgets

Market legal budgets remain **\$100‑250 k** for a master‑feeder with ERISA toggle $6$. Most of the spend is on the LPA, PPM, subscription docs, AML/KYC and in‑kind crypto contribution language.

#### Operational pain‑points (crypto specific)

* **Custody** – SAB 121 calls into question balance‑sheet treatment for banks; availability of SOC‑1/SOC‑2 reports drives auditor comfort.
* **Banking** – Customers Bank and Cross River still dominate operating accounts; each imposes crypto‑specific concentration caps $3$–$9$.
* **Transfer‑agent substitute** – most funds maintain the register on Carta or AngelList; large allocators increasingly require an independent fund admin.

#### 20‑Factor Walk‑Through for Private Funds
| #      | Parameter                   | What it means for a 3(c)(1)/(7) crypto fund                                                                                                       |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**  | **Investor cap**            | Choose 99 investors (any accredited) **or** 2,000 investors all of whom are QPs. Parallel feeders can blend both.                                 |
| **2**  | **Investor type**           | Must be Accredited (506(b/c)) or QP (3(c)(7)); ERISA 25 % test still applies.                                                                     |
| **3**  | **Min ticket**              | Not fixed by law—usually \$250 k–\$1 m for operational efficiency.                                                                                |
| **4**  | **Liquidity**               | GP‑set lock‑ups (often 12‑24 m) plus quarterly/annual redemption gates; crypto funds often add 25 % “override” suspension for extreme volatility. |
| **5**  | **Key form**                | Only Form D; Form PF & ADV apply to the adviser, not the fund.                                                                                    |
| **6**  | **’33 Act fee**             | None—private placement.                                                                                                                           |
| **7**  | **1940 Act reg**            | Fully exempt; therefore no Rule 17f‑5 custody protections, leverage caps or board requirements.                                                   |
| **8**  | **Audit duty**              | GAAP audit; must be delivered within 120 days; PFAR now hard‑wires it. ([SEC][1])                                                                 |
| **9**  | **Custody rule**            | Advisers‑Act Rule 206(4)‑2; still uncertain how to hold native tokens post‑SAB 121.                                                               |
| **10** | **Board independence**      | N/A—LPs rely on GP fiduciary duties and LPAC approval rights.                                                                                     |
| **11** | **Leverage limit**          | Set solely by the LPA; crypto hedge funds may permit repo/derivatives to 200–300 % gross exposure.                                                |
| **12** | **Reporting**               | Form PF & quarterly PFAR statements; ad‑hoc tear‑sheets.                                                                                          |
| **13** | **Marketing**               | Private placement memorandum (PPM); if using 506(c) any website/social post must be archived for five years.                                      |
| **14** | **Timeline**                | 6–12 weeks (draft docs, open bank account, AML/KYC, Form D).                                                                                      |
| **15** | **Legal budget**            | \$100‑250 k (docs, Blue‑sky, trademark clearance, ERISA). $6$                                                                                     |
| **16** | **Annual SEC/OCC fee**      | None beyond Blue‑sky renewals.                                                                                                                    |
| **17** | **Illiquid cap**            | LPA defines side‑pocket % (commonly 20–30 % NAV).                                                                                                 |
| **18** | **ESG/name rule**           | Adviser disclosure only; cannot use “ESG” or “green” misleadingly post‑2022 Name‑Rule proposal.                                                   |
| **19** | **Digital‑asset precedent** | Pantera Onshore, Multicoin Onshore, Paradigm Main Fund.                                                                                           |
| **20** | **Favoured bank**           | Mercury for ops; Customers Bank (CBIT) for 24/7 fiat rail.                                                                                        |

### What this means for you

1. **Choose the redemption profile first**—it determines whether you live under the Mutual Funds Act equivalent (’40 Act) or can stay exempt.
2. **Budget realistically**: SEC filing fees are trivial compared with the US \$0.3‑0.9 m in legal, audit and board costs to run a registered product.
3. **Pre‑clear custody & banking**: large U.S. banks will currently open accounts only for structures subject to the ’40 Act or OCC oversight.
4. **Watch 2025 rule changes**: the SEC’s Private‑Fund Adviser Rules now force quarterly fee breakdowns even for 3(c)(7) crypto funds, while proposed liquidity‑risk amendments could hit interval‑fund repurchase levels.

*All figures reflect fee schedules and rule texts in force as of **May 28 2025**; always confirm current SEC and OCC notices before filing.*
