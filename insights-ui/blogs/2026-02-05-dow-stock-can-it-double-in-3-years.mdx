## A) Anchor selection

For Dow, the best **PRIMARY anchor is EV/EBITDA on a mid-cycle (normalized) view**, because this is a capital-intensive, commodity-leaning chemicals business where depreciation is large and earnings swing hard with industry spreads. In FY2025, EBITDA was about **$3.15B** on **~$40.0B** of revenue, while EBIT was only **~$0.3B** and net income was negative, which shows why **P/E** and **EV/EBIT** are simply not stable anchors in a trough year with impairments/restructuring and high D&A. EV/EBITDA also forces you to respect the capital structure: with meaningful net debt, equity value can move a lot even when enterprise value moves less, so this anchor naturally ties back to **per-share outcomes** rather than hand-waving market cap.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #1 is Price-to-Book (P/B)**, because for commodity chemicals the market often “marks the cycle” by valuing the asset base and balance-sheet resilience when earnings are temporarily depressed. This is more informative than earnings-based anchors precisely when profits are noisy: if the company is near a trough, P/B helps answer whether the stock is pricing in stress, and whether the balance sheet (and replacement-cost logic) provides a floor. It captures something EBITDA can miss in the short run: **whether losses, dividends, and other comprehensive items are eroding equity**, which matters for long-only PMs who care about downside survivability as much as upside.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #2 is cash return capacity via Dividend yield and “normalized” free cash flow (FCF) yield**, because this business can look optically cheap on revenue or book while still being a weak equity if cash conversion is poor. Dow’s reported FCF has swung from **~$4.6–$5.2B** in FY2021–FY2022 to **negative in FY2024–FY2025**, largely because working capital and the cycle can overwhelm reported earnings and because sustaining capex is substantial. This second check is necessary because it catches the blind spot that EV/EBITDA can miss: **how much of EBITDA truly becomes distributable cash per share after capex, working capital, interest, and dividends**, and whether the capital structure forces dilution or debt growth.

## B) The 3–4 driver framework

**Driver 1 is the EBITDA margin (spread cycle) in core commodity chains like polyethylene and industrial intermediates**, because small changes in product-to-feedstock spreads can create large swings in EBITDA dollars. In the last five years, EBITDA margin moved from roughly **~20% (FY2021)** to **~15% (FY2022)** to **~11–12% (FY2023–FY2024)** and then down to **~8% (FY2025)**, which is exactly the pattern you expect in a cyclical chemicals downturn. This driver directly feeds the primary anchor (EV/EBITDA) because if EBITDA per share rises materially off a depressed base, the enterprise value the market is willing to pay can rise even if the multiple stays flat or even compresses.

**Driver 2 is revenue/volume (and mix) growth, but treated conservatively as “GDP-like” rather than a secular hyper-growth story**, because most of the portfolio is tied to packaging, industrial, construction, and mobility demand that tends to track the cycle. Revenue has fallen from **~$55B–$57B (FY2021–FY2022)** to **~$40B (FY2025)**, so even a “normal” recovery can lift EBITDA simply by improving utilization and pricing power rather than by heroic volume growth. This driver matters for all three anchors: higher revenue at stable spreads supports higher EBITDA; it supports book value only if it translates into sustained net income after dividends; and it supports dividend/FCF only if growth is not purchased with disproportionately higher capex.

**Driver 3 is cash conversion (operating cash flow minus sustaining capex, plus/minus working capital),** because chemicals routinely produce “paper profits” that do not become cash in the wrong part of the cycle. The company spent roughly **~$2.6B–$3.3B** per year on capex recently, and working capital has been a real swing factor (for example FY2025 showed a material working-capital drag). This driver is the backbone of the dividend/FCF cross-check: even if EBITDA rebounds, you only get per-share upside if the business can generate enough cash to avoid debt creep, protect the dividend, and eventually resume buybacks.

**Driver 4 is capital structure and per-share policy (net debt level, interest burden, and share count change),** because leverage amplifies equity outcomes in both directions. Net debt is sizable (on the order of **~$15–$16B** by balance sheet “net cash” being strongly negative), and recent share count has been roughly **~705–717M**, moving only modestly year to year, which implies most of the equity return will come from **fundamentals and valuation**, not from big buyback shrinkage. This driver ties to EV/EBITDA through the equity bridge (EV minus net debt), to P/B through whether the balance sheet is strengthening or weakening, and to dividend/FCF through whether interest and debt reduction absorb the first dollars of recovery cash.

## C) Baseline snapshot

As of **February 3, 2026**, the stock is around **$30.38**. With roughly **~717M shares** outstanding, that implies a market cap near **~$22B**; combining that with net debt that is roughly **mid-teens billions** (balance sheet “net cash” is about **-$15.8B** at FY2025) implies enterprise value in the **high-$30Bs**. Against that, FY2025 revenue was **~$40.0B** and EBITDA **~$3.15B** (EBITDA margin **~7.9%**), while FCF was **~-$1.6B** and capex was **~$2.6B**, which is why the stock can look “cheap” on sales but still feel cash-constrained. Book value per share in FY2025 was roughly **~$22**, and the current dividend run-rate appears lower than the prior **$2.8** level, reflecting that cash return policy has already been pressured by the downcycle.

Over the last 3–5 years, the story is a classic cycle compression rather than steady compounding: revenue fell from **~$55B–$57B (FY2021–FY2022)** to **~$44.6B (FY2023)** to **~$43.0B (FY2024)** to **~$40.0B (FY2025)**, while EBITDA dropped from **~$10.9B** to **~$8.7B** to **~$5.2B** to **~$5.1B** to **~$3.15B**. Free cash flow was strongly positive in the upcycle (**~$4.6B–$5.2B** in FY2021–FY2022), still positive in FY2023 (**~$2.5B**), and then turned negative in FY2024–FY2025, which signals that the “trough” is not only about margins but also about cash timing and reinvestment needs. The implication for operating leverage is important: if spreads normalize even partway back toward FY2023–FY2024 conditions, EBITDA can rebound meaningfully, but the market will likely demand evidence that cash conversion has also normalized before assigning a much higher equity value per share.

## D) 2× Hurdle vs Likely Path

A “**2× in 3 years**” outcome means the stock price roughly doubles, which is about **~26% per year** compounded (because ~26% per year for three years is approximately ~2×). In a mature, cyclical chemicals business, that kind of return typically requires more than “steady execution”; it usually needs a **cycle upswing** that lifts per-share fundamentals materially, plus either stable valuation or at least no severe multiple compression. Because net debt is meaningful, equity can indeed rise faster than enterprise value, but that leverage cuts both ways: if the recovery is delayed or cash stays weak, the same leverage can cap buybacks, pressure dividends, and keep valuation subdued.

On the **EV/EBITDA primary anchor**, doubling the equity from roughly **~$22B** to **~$44B** (using today’s ballpark market cap) would push enterprise value toward roughly **~$59B** if net debt stays around the mid-teens billions, meaning EV needs to rise about **~1.6×**. If the market eventually values the company at something like **~8–10× EV/EBITDA** in a more normal earnings environment (a practical band for cyclical industrials that rarely hold “peak” multiples at “peak” profits), then EBITDA would need to be roughly **~$6B–$7B** to justify that EV, which is about **~2×** the FY2025 EBITDA base. On the **P/B cross-check**, doubling the price to about **~$60** requires either a very high P/B on today’s book value or, more plausibly, a combination of **book value rebuilding** plus a P/B that returns to a more optimistic part of its historical band; that demands **sustained profitability well above the dividend**, not just one good quarter. On the **dividend/FCF cross-check**, a $60 stock with a roughly **~$1.4** annual dividend would imply a **~2%–3%** yield, which is hard to justify for a cyclical chemical producer unless the market believes cash flows are much stronger and more stable than the recent experience; therefore, 2× requires either a meaningfully higher dividend again and/or visibly strong FCF that makes a lower yield feel safe.

Based on the company’s own history, the most conservative “likely” path over the next three years is a **partial normalization**, not a full return to the FY2021 peak. Revenue is most likely to be **flat to low-single-digit growth** (roughly **0%–3% per year**) because end markets are largely GDP-like and the company is already scaled, so the bigger swing should come from margins. A reasonable EBITDA margin range in a “similar regime” is **~10%–12.5%** (because FY2023–FY2024 already lived around ~11%–12%), which would put EBITDA in the neighborhood of **~$4.5B–$5.5B** if revenue is **~$40B–$44B**. Cash conversion is likely to improve from FY2025’s negative FCF if working capital stops being a headwind and capex stays controlled, but given recent capex around **~$2.6B–$3.2B**, a conservative base-case FCF range is **~$0.5B–$2.0B** per year rather than a straight snapback to $5B, and that implies share count reduction is likely modest (roughly **0% to ~1% per year** at best) until the balance sheet and dividend feel fully protected.

Industry logic supports those “likely” ranges because commodity chemical profitability is set by the supply/demand balance and global capacity additions, not by product differentiation alone. Even with a cost advantage in U.S. feedstocks and integration, a downcycle can persist when the industry is long capacity, which is why expecting a return to **high-teens EBITDA margins** (like FY2021) would implicitly assume unusually tight markets or unusually strong pricing power that is not “normal” for large polyethylene and intermediates chains. The company’s more specialized coatings and performance materials help stabilize results, but they are not large enough to fully de-risk the cycle, so the base case should assume **mid-cycle spreads**, not peak spreads. In that environment, management’s first call on recovered cash is usually **maintenance capex, dividend safety, and debt control**, which means buybacks (the lever that can boost per-share outcomes) tend to come later and in smaller size than investors hope.

Comparing required versus likely across the anchors highlights why 2× is not a base case. The EV/EBITDA path to 2× needs EBITDA closer to **~$6B–$7B** (or, alternatively, today’s relatively high “trough” multiple to stay high even as EBITDA rises), while the more historically consistent outcome is **~$4.5B–$5.5B**, and cyclicals commonly see **multiple compression** as profits recover, creating a gap that is roughly “one more leg” of cycle strength beyond a normal rebound. The P/B path needs book value per share to **rebuild** after falling from the high-$20s to low-$20s and then also needs the market to pay a meaningfully higher P/B again, which requires several years of profits comfortably above dividends and without large adverse comprehensive items. The dividend/FCF check needs a clear return to **durable positive FCF** and either a dividend restoration or investor confidence that the business is far less cyclical than recent results suggest, which is a high bar right after dividend pressure and negative FCF. **Net: fundamentals imply ~1.3× to ~1.7×; 2× requires stronger-than-mid-cycle EBITDA plus non-compressing multiples and a visibly restored cash-return profile that are above recent history/industry/business reality.**

## E) Business reality check

Operationally, the way the business “wins” in the base case is not by inventing a new growth engine, but by **running its advantaged assets well through the cycle**: improving utilization as demand normalizes, capturing better product-to-feedstock spreads in polyethylene and intermediates, and maintaining disciplined pricing and mix in the more specialized performance materials lines. That operational picture maps directly to the drivers: better utilization and spreads lift EBITDA margin; steady volumes keep revenue from sliding; cost discipline and capex control improve cash conversion; and stronger cash flow allows debt to drift down while protecting the dividend, improving the per-share equity story.

The realistic constraints are exactly the usual failure modes in commodity chemicals: if global capacity stays long or demand stays soft, pricing competition can prevent margin recovery even if volumes are stable, which breaks the EBITDA-margin driver and undermines EV/EBITDA upside. If working capital absorbs cash (for example through inventory builds or slower receivables) while capex remains high, reported EBITDA can rise without FCF improving, which breaks the dividend/FCF anchor and can force debt to remain elevated. If the company prioritizes dividend defense while cash is still weak, it may limit buybacks and keep share count flat, which reduces the per-share compounding that often helps reach high multipliers in three years.

When you reconcile the business logic with the numbers, the **base-case improvement looks incremental and plausible**, because it mainly assumes a return toward FY2023–FY2024-type margins and cash conversion rather than a return to FY2021 peak conditions. However, the **2× outcome is more “step-change” than incremental**, because it effectively requires either a near-peak profitability environment (or at least a much stronger margin rebound than mid-cycle) while also avoiding the typical multiple compression that comes when a cyclical recovery becomes obvious. Said differently: you can plausibly get a solid re-rating from “trough stress” to “mid-cycle normal,” but going from there to “2× in three years” needs a second layer of favorable cycle strength and cash return normalization.

## F) Multi-anchor triangulation

### Primary anchor

Using EV/EBITDA, the baseline is roughly FY2025 EBITDA of **~$3.15B** against an enterprise value in the **high-$30B** range when you combine a market cap around **~$22B** with net debt in the mid-teens billions, implying an EV/EBITDA that is **around the low-teens** today because the “E” is depressed. That “high” multiple is not necessarily optimism; it is often what happens mechanically at a trough when EBITDA is cyclically low, and it is why you should think in terms of **normalized EBITDA** rather than extrapolating the current multiple.

For the next three years, a conservative set of inputs is revenue roughly **~$40B–$44B** (flat to low-single-digit growth), EBITDA margin recovering to **~10%–12.5%** (consistent with FY2023–FY2024 being around ~11%–12% rather than assuming a peak), capex staying near **~$2.6B–$3.2B**, and net debt drifting down modestly by **~$1B–$3B** if FCF turns positive. On valuation, it is reasonable to assume the EV/EBITDA multiple **falls** toward **~8–10×** as EBITDA improves, because cyclical industrials typically do not hold “trough” multiples at “mid-cycle” earnings; investors tend to pay lower multiples on higher earnings when they believe earnings are closer to a cyclical high.

Translating that to a 3-year multiplier, if EBITDA rises from **~$3.15B** to **~$4.5B–$5.5B** (about **~1.4×–1.7×**) but the multiple compresses from ~12× toward ~9× (about **~0.75×**), enterprise value ends up closer to **flat to ~1.3×**, and with only modest net debt reduction the equity value plausibly lands around **~1.2×–1.7×**. The low end happens if the cycle stays soft and EBITDA only reaches ~4B while the multiple compresses anyway, leaving EV and equity little changed; the high end happens if EBITDA reaches the **mid-$5Bs** and debt is reduced enough that a given EV gain translates into a larger equity gain per share. To actually land at ~2× on this anchor, you generally need EBITDA closer to **~$6B–$7B** (roughly “more than mid-cycle”) _and_ a multiple that does not compress aggressively, which is a bull-case combination.

### Cross-check anchor #1

On P/B, the baseline reference point is book value per share around **~$22** at FY2025, with the stock in the **~$30** area, implying P/B in the **low-to-mid 1s** today depending on the exact date and book measure. The reason this anchor matters is that book value has **not** been steadily compounding in the last few years; it has moved down from the high-$20s toward the low-$20s as the cycle weakened and cash returns absorbed equity, so a P/B-based upside case must include a credible path for book value to rebuild, not just “the multiple goes up.”

A realistic three-year input set is that net income returns to being meaningfully positive but not peak, something like **~$1B–$3B** in good years, while the dividend run-rate remains around **~$1.4** annually (about **~$1.0B** total cash dividends per year on ~700M shares) and buybacks are modest until cash is clearly positive. In that setup, book value per share could plausibly rise from **~$22** toward **~$24–$27** if profits exceed dividends and if there are no big adverse balance-sheet marks, and the market could pay a P/B of **~1.3–1.8** if sentiment shifts from “stress” to “normal.” This is reasonable because P/B tends to expand when ROE normalizes and investors believe the cycle is improving, but it is constrained because heavy dividends and cyclical volatility limit how fast equity compounds.

That math implies a price range of roughly **~$31 to ~$49** over three years (because ~$24–$27 BVPS times ~1.3–1.8 P/B), which is about **~1.0×–1.6×** from today’s ~$30 level. The low end occurs if profits only cover the dividend (book barely grows) and the market keeps P/B near ~1.2–1.4; the high end occurs if profitability is strong enough to rebuild book into the high-$20s and P/B re-rates closer to ~1.8. To hit ~2× on this anchor, you typically need both **BVPS back near ~$28–$30** and **P/B around ~2.0**, which essentially requires a multi-year profit run nearer the stronger part of the cycle plus confidence that the balance sheet is strengthening, not just stabilizing.

### Cross-check anchor #2

On dividend and FCF yield, the baseline is a dividend run-rate that looks closer to **~$1.4 per year** after the 2025 reduction, which at a ~$30 stock price is a mid-single-digit yield, while reported FY2025 free cash flow was **negative (~-$1.6B)**. This anchor is intentionally “harsh” because it forces the thesis to answer: if the company is in a cyclical recovery, will that recovery show up as **cash per share** in time to justify a materially higher stock price, or will cash be absorbed by capex, working capital, and debt?

A reasonable three-year input set is that FCF normalizes to **~$1B–$3B** as margins recover and working capital stops being a headwind, while capex remains in the **~$2.6B–$3.2B** band that reflects the reality of maintaining and upgrading large chemical assets. In a similar regime, it is conservative to assume the market wants a dividend yield still around **~4%–6%** for a cyclical chemical name unless the cycle becomes unusually stable, and it is also conservative to assume that until FCF is clearly positive, management keeps cash returns cautious (so dividend growth is gradual and buybacks are limited). Those assumptions are grounded in the company’s own recent pattern: when FCF weakened, dividends were pressured and buybacks diminished.

If the dividend stays around **~$1.4**, it is hard to justify a $60 stock on yield alone because that would push the yield near **~2%–3%**, which is more like a stable consumer staple than a cyclical chemical producer; that points to a **sub-2×** outcome in the base case. If instead the dividend is restored toward **~$2.0–$2.8** and investors accept a ~5% yield, that implies a price of roughly **~$40–$56**, which is about **~1.3×–1.8×**. The estimate lands low if FCF stays choppy and the dividend remains constrained (yield stays high because price can’t run), and it lands high if FCF turns clearly positive and durable, giving management room to raise the dividend and the market confidence to accept a lower required yield.

## G) Valuation sanity check

Valuation is more likely **neutral to a headwind** than a clean tailwind on the primary anchor, because EV/EBITDA _looks_ high today mainly because EBITDA is depressed, and in cyclical businesses the multiple often **compresses** as the cycle improves. Practically, you can see that in the company’s own history: when EBITDA was much higher in FY2021–FY2022, EV/EBITDA was in the mid-single digits, while in weaker years it has been closer to high-single digits to low-teens. On the P/B anchor, valuation is closer to **neutral/slight tailwind** because P/B is not elevated and could revert upward if profitability normalizes, but the constraint is that book value has been under pressure, so the “multiple” cannot do all the work without book rebuilding.

Putting that together, a conservative “similar regime” valuation multiplier over three years is roughly **~0.85× to ~1.10×**, where the low end reflects EV/EBITDA compressing as EBITDA recovers (a common pattern in cyclicals) and the high end reflects sentiment normalizing and P/B moving modestly higher if profits and cash flow stabilize. This is not an academic claim; it simply reflects that the market usually does not give you both **a big earnings rebound and a higher multiple** in commodity cyclicals unless the cycle becomes structurally tighter than normal.

## H) Final answer

The **most likely 3-year price multiplier** for DOW is **~1.3× to ~1.7×**, because a mid-cycle recovery in EBITDA from a depressed FY2025 base is plausible, but the usual offsetting forces—multiple compression as earnings normalize, meaningful net debt, and limited buybacks until cash flow is durable—reduce the probability of a clean 2× on a conservative view.

A reasonable **bull-case** is **~1.8× to ~2.3×**, but it requires several things to go right at the same time: EBITDA needs to rebound toward **~$6B–$7B** (implying margins closer to the stronger part of the cycle rather than merely mid-cycle), free cash flow needs to be convincingly positive (enabling debt reduction and a dividend path back toward the prior level), and the market needs to avoid the typical “profits up, multiple down” pattern by holding valuation around **~8–9× EV/EBITDA** instead of compressing hard as the recovery becomes visible.

**Borderline.** Monitor quarterly net sales and year-over-year growth; quarterly EBITDA and EBITDA margin; quarterly operating cash flow; quarterly capex spend; quarterly free cash flow; net debt level; net debt to EBITDA; interest expense run-rate; shares outstanding and net buyback issuance; annualized dividend per share and payout versus trailing free cash flow.
