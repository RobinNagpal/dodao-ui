# Marketing Guidelines at KoalaGains (or DoDAO)

## Introduction

One of the general recommendations for working on something is to work with your strengths and not be limited by your weaknesses.

Here are our strengths

* We are technical and hardworking people
* We understand the concepts
* We talk to the point and in simple english which everyone can understand
* We are geeks, can/cannot be introverts

Here are our weaknesses

* We are not that good at making innovative content
* We don't know memes, jokes, etc

## Guidelines for Presentations

We have to follow SCSE rule at DoDAO while making presentations.

To Do Checklist

- [ ] Simple
- [ ] Conversational - No jargon. Write as if you are talking to your friend
- [ ] Specific - No general statements and should not repeat
- [ ] Explicit - Make it clear to the reader what you are trying to say. Don't think they will understand it.

Not to Do Checklist

- [ ] No jargon or abstract language like "this is a great product", "This is a great opportunity", "It saves a lot of time and effort"? Explain how it saves time and effort.
- [ ] No fancy like "Welcome ot the world of AI", "Welcome to the future", "Welcome to the world of AI". We dont talk to friends like this. This is not conversational
- [ ] No repetition. If you have said something once, don't repeat it again.

## Guidelines for Social Media

To Do Checklist

- [ ] Every post should have food for thought
- [ ] Every single post should be complete in itself that means the user learns from it without having to go to another post or source.
- [ ] Editing should be very simple and basic without many colors.
- [ ] Be consistent across all posts with font size, font type, colors and every other thing.
- [ ] Keep the posts as simple as possible.
- [ ] Keep the post clean and well-structured.

Not to Do Checklist

- [ ] Do not add too much colors to the post
- [ ] Don't add irrelevant pictures.

**How Marketing Works at DoDAO:**

* You can’t write about something unless you fully understand it.
* ChatGPT won’t write for you based on your guidelines.
* You must draft everything yourself.
* ChatGPT can help enhance or shorten your content, but only after you’ve written it.
* The first post is always the hardest.
* Writing yourself makes **SCSE** easy to achieve.
* Marketing at DoDAO is about **explaining concepts clearly and simply—nothing more.**
