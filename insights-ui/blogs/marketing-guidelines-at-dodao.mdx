# Marketing Guidelines at KoalaGains (or DoDAO)


## Introduction
One of the general recommendations for working on something is to work with your strengths and not be limited by
your weaknesses.

Here are our strengths
- We are technical and hardworking people
- We understand the concepts
- We talk to the point and in simple english which everyone can understand
- We are geeks, can/cannot be introverts\
- 


Here are our weaknesses
- We are not that good at making innovative content
- We don't know memes, jokes, etc

## Guidelines for Presentations
SCSE

To Do Checklist
- [ ] Simple
- [ ] Conversational - No jargon. Write as if you are talking to your friend
- [ ] Specific - No general statements and should not repeat
- [ ] Explicit - Make it clear to the reader what you are trying to say. Don't think they will understand it.

Not to Do Checklist
- [ ] No jargon or abstract language like "this is a great product", "This is a great opportunity", "It saves a lot of time and effort"? Explain how it saves time and effort.
- [ ] No fancy like "Welcome ot the world of AI", "Welcome to the future", "Welcome to the world of AI". We dont talk to friends like this. This is not conversational
- [ ] No repetition. If you have said something once, don't repeat it again.

## Guidelines for Social Media

## Key Learnings

* You cannot write about anything until you understand it completely.
* Chat Gpt can't write for you on your guidelines.
* You have to write it yourself for each and every point. 
* Then you can ask chat gpt to either enhance it or shorten it.
* The first post is always the hardest.
* The first idea takes time to come. Then you come up with 3-4 ideas quickly and after that you run out of ideas. 
* When you write it yourself, fulfilling SCSE is not hard.
* Writing at DoDAO for marketing purposes is actually just explaining the concept simply, nothing else.
