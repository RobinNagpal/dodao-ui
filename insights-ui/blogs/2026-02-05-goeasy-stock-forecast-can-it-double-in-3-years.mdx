## 0) Overall analysis (one paragraph, 6–8 lines)

Over the next ~3 years, non-prime consumer credit in Canada is more likely to stay stable to modestly expand than to shrink, because banks tend to tighten underwriting in uncertain periods and immigration/new-to-credit keeps demand structurally present; the trade-off is that credit losses can rise quickly in a weak job market. Investor “hype” is clearly not a tailwind here: goeasy is being valued like a cyclical credit-risk business (low P/E, high dividend yield), which signals the market is already pricing in sustained elevated provisions and/or regulatory friction rather than a smooth growth story. Operationally, goeasy’s trajectory still looks like a share-gainer inside its niche (omnichannel origination + scale funding + long repayment dataset), and management has already shifted the portfolio toward more secured lending and lower weighted rates over time. The biggest reason ~2× is hard is that you need both strong per-share earnings compounding _and_ a meaningful re-rating in a domain that structurally trades at a discount because regulation, funding costs, and credit losses can swing fast.

## 1) PRIMARY framework / anchor: P/E (price-to-earnings)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline (1 paragraph)

P/E is the cleanest primary anchor for goeasy because “earnings” already embed the core mechanics that matter most for a non-prime lender—funding costs, credit losses, and operating cost discipline—so it directly reflects whether the market trusts the sustainability of the spread and underwriting. The baseline valuation is roughly ~9× trailing P/E today (with ~6–7× forward P/E implied by market quotes), on a share count around ~16.0M shares outstanding, which is consistent with a market that is discounting a tougher credit environment rather than paying up for growth.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path (exactly 4 sub-paragraphs)

Paragraph 1 (Hurdle definition): \
A “2× in 3 years” outcome requires roughly ~26% per year compounded. In plain terms, that usually means some combination of (a) per-share earnings rising a lot (because price ultimately follows per-share earnings power over time), and/or (b) the market paying a higher earnings multiple as perceived risk falls. If the P/E multiple stays flat, EPS must roughly double; if EPS rises “only” ~40–60%, then the P/E must also expand meaningfully to bridge the rest.

Paragraph 2 (Anchor hurdles): \
Under a P/E lens, ~2× is realistic only if you can get something like ~20%+ per-year EPS compounding _or_ a strong mix of moderate EPS growth plus a re-rating. For example, ~15% per year EPS growth is about ~1.52× over 3 years; to reach ~2× from there, the P/E would need to expand by roughly another ~1.3× (e.g., ~9× to ~12×). That kind of multiple expansion only happens if credit losses feel “contained and repeatable,” regulation stops tightening, and funding spreads don’t surprise to the upside.

Paragraph 3 (Likely fundamentals — company history): \
The company’s own trajectory shows both the growth engine and the volatility: consumer loans receivable have been growing (loan receivables: ~$4.37B FY24 → ~$5.17B Q3’25), but quarterly profitability can swing with provisioning. Based on what goeasy has already been doing—shifting toward secured products and lowering the weighted average customer rate over time (weighted average interest rate on the portfolio was shown around ~27.9% as of June 30, 2025, with most of the book already at or below the 35% cap) —a conservative 3-year driver set looks like: loan book growth in the ~10–15% per year range (slower than the recent run-rate to respect macro uncertainty), portfolio yield roughly stable-to-slightly-down as mix shifts (Q3’25 loan yield cited ~31.4% while net charge-off ran ~8.9%), credit losses staying in a “high but manageable” band rather than sharply improving, and modest ongoing share reduction (buybacks have been active, so even ~1–2% annual net share shrink can add ~3–6% to 3-year EPS versus a flat share count).

Paragraph 4 (Required vs likely gap): \
To justify ~2× primarily through P/E, the “required” case is basically: EPS must compound closer to ~18–25% per year _and/or_ the market must be willing to re-rate the stock from a stressed multiple (~9×) back toward a more normal multiple (low-teens). The “likely” case, if we stay conservative about credit losses and assume growth moderates, is more like EPS compounding around ~10–16% per year (including buyback help) with only partial re-rating. Net: fundamentals imply ~1.3× to ~1.6×; 2× requires credit costs to improve faster than a cautious cycle view and a re-rating toward ~12×+ that is above what the market typically pays during “still-watched” credit periods.

### C) Outcome under this anchor (exactly 1 paragraph)

Baseline is ~9× trailing P/E today (with market-implied forward P/E in the mid-single digits), on a business that is still growing receivables but showing provision volatility (Q3’25 showed ~31.4% yield, ~8.9% net charge-off, and a meaningful EPS hit from provisioning). For a conservative 3-year input set, I use EPS growth of ~10–16% per year (loan growth ~10–15% with stable-to-slightly-down yield under the post-cap pricing mix, credit losses staying elevated but not spiraling, plus ~1–2% per year net share reduction), which translates to roughly ~1.33× to ~1.56× EPS over 3 years. The low end is driven by higher-for-longer charge-offs/funding costs and slower originations; the high end requires steadier credit and continued buyback discipline. On valuation, today’s P/E is below the long-run median shown in third-party history sets (median ~11–12×; wide range historically), so valuation is more likely a mild tailwind than a headwind, but only if credit fears fade; that supports a reasonable 3-year P/E change of roughly ~0.9× to ~1.3× (down to ~8× in a stressed outcome, up to ~11–12× if the cycle stabilizes).

## 2) CROSS-CHECK framework / anchor #1: P/B (price-to-book)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline (1 paragraph)

P/B is a strong cross-check for goeasy because it forces the question: “what is the market paying for each dollar of equity supporting a leveraged loan book,” which is often how financials re-rate when confidence in underwriting and funding normalizes. The baseline today is roughly ~1.7–1.8× P/B (book value per share in the mid-$70s recently, with the stock around the mid-$120s), which is consistent with a market that still credits goeasy for profitability but refuses to pay a premium multiple while charge-offs and regulation remain headline risks.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path (exactly 4 sub-paragraphs)

Paragraph 1 (Hurdle definition): \
A 2× price outcome over 3 years under P/B means either book value per share rises dramatically, or the market decides to pay a much higher multiple of book (or both). If P/B stayed flat, BVPS would need to roughly double; if BVPS rises ~40–50%, then P/B must also expand meaningfully to get to ~2×.

Paragraph 2 (Anchor hurdles): \
To get ~2× through P/B, you need a mix like: BVPS compounding ~14–17% per year (about ~1.5–1.6× over 3 years) _and_ P/B expanding from ~1.7× to ~2.2–2.4× (about ~1.3×). That combination usually requires sustained high ROE with no “surprise” credit losses plus a market belief that the business has moved to a safer, more resilient mix (secured share up, pricing discipline proven under the 35% cap).

Paragraph 3 (Likely fundamentals — company history): \
Company disclosures show this de-risking pattern already underway: secured mix has been rising over time while weighted average interest rates have been stepping down (for example, the company shows secured share moving materially higher since 2019 and a weighted average interest rate of consumer loans moving down to ~29% by 2024). That kind of mix shift is supportive of “steadier” book value growth, but the other side of the ledger is that net charge-offs have remained around ~9% in recent periods (the same exhibit shows charge-offs staying in that neighborhood), which caps how aggressively we should assume ROE and retention will translate into BVPS compounding. Conservatively, if ROE is more like “high-teens to low-20s” through a normal cycle and the payout stays meaningful (dividends plus some buybacks), BVPS compounding around ~10–15% per year is more realistic than the ~17%+ you’d want for an easy 2×.

Paragraph 4 (Required vs likely gap): \
The “required” case implies both high ROE and high retained earnings while the market simultaneously re-rates the stock closer to premium P/B levels. The “likely” case is that BVPS grows solidly but not explosively because credit losses and funding spreads remain a swing factor and because the company returns cash via dividends; meanwhile, P/B re-rating is possible but usually partial unless the market becomes convinced the credit cycle risk has been tamed. Net: fundamentals imply ~1.3× to ~1.6×; 2× requires unusually strong ROE persistence plus a jump toward ~2.3×+ P/B that is above what a conservative credit-cycle view should assume.

### C) Outcome under this anchor (exactly 1 paragraph)

Baseline is ~1.7–1.8× P/B today, and a business model that is demonstrably shifting toward secured lending and lower weighted average pricing while keeping charge-offs in the high-single-digit range over time. Using conservative inputs—BVPS growth of ~10–15% per year (supported by strong profitability but tempered by dividends and cycle risk), plus modest net share reduction that can slightly lift BVPS per share—book value per share plausibly reaches ~1.33× to ~1.52× over 3 years. The low end corresponds to higher provisions and slower asset growth; the high end requires stable funding and “no negative surprises” in credit. For valuation, history-based third-party ranges suggest today is closer to the lower end than the typical median (median P/B around ~2.3× in one long-range dataset), so a reasonable re-rating band is ~0.9× to ~1.2× (for example, ~1.6× if stress persists versus ~2.0–2.1× if the market regains confidence).

## 3) CROSS-CHECK framework / anchor #2: Dividend yield (yield + growth mean-reversion)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline (1 paragraph)

Dividend yield is a useful cross-check because goeasy now has a meaningful cash return profile, and in “out-of-favor” financials the market often anchors price to a yield band that feels sustainable for the cycle. The baseline is an annual dividend around CAD ~$5.84 and a current yield around ~4.6%, implying the market is demanding a high cash yield to hold the credit risk.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path (exactly 4 sub-paragraphs)

Paragraph 1 (Hurdle definition): \
If the stock price doubles but the dividend does not, the dividend yield would be cut roughly in half—so a 2× outcome through a dividend lens is essentially a bet on both dividend growth and yield compression (the market accepting a lower yield because it trusts the earnings/credit outlook). If the yield stayed around ~4.6%, the dividend itself would need to roughly double to justify a ~2× price, which is a very high bar in a regulated, cyclical lender.

Paragraph 2 (Anchor hurdles): \
A plausible “math path” to 2× would look like dividend per share rising roughly ~30–40% over 3 years _and_ the yield compressing from ~4.6% toward ~3.0–3.3%. That requires the market to treat goeasy more like a “stable compounder” than a “credit-cycle risk,” which usually only happens after multiple quarters of contained charge-offs and a clear post-cap operating steady state.

Paragraph 3 (Likely fundamentals — company history): \
The company has been proactively adjusting pricing and mix ahead of regulation (it highlights the 35% APR cap effective Jan 1, 2025, with a weighted average interest rate around ~27.9% and most of the portfolio already at or below the cap), which supports dividend sustainability, but provisioning volatility remains a reality (Q3’25 showed a large provision impact even while yield and charge-offs were in the “expected” zone). Conservatively, that suggests dividend growth is more likely to slow to something like ~8–12% per year (about ~1.26× to ~1.40× over 3 years) rather than staying in a “high teens” mode, because management needs flexibility for credit and funding conditions.

Paragraph 4 (Required vs likely gap): \
If dividends grow ~8–12% per year, getting to 2× still requires yield to compress aggressively to near ~3%, which is hard to assume conservatively for a non-prime lender in a world where regulation and credit headlines do not disappear. A more conservative expectation is that yield may compress modestly (say toward ~3.5–4.5%) if credit stabilizes, which supports meaningful upside but not an automatic doubling. Net: fundamentals imply ~1.2× to ~1.8×; 2× requires yield compression to “quality-financial” territory plus steady earnings that reduces the market’s demanded risk premium.

### C) Outcome under this anchor (exactly 1 paragraph)

Baseline is a ~4.6% dividend yield on a ~CAD $5.84 dividend, which signals the market wants to be paid for credit and regulatory risk. If dividends grow ~8–12% per year (reasonable given earnings power but mindful of cycle volatility), dividend per share becomes roughly ~1.26× to ~1.40× in 3 years; the low end reflects elevated provisions limiting payout growth, and the high end assumes steadier credit and continued profitability. Valuation-wise, the yield itself is the “multiple”: if the market keeps demanding ~4.5–5.0% yield, price appreciation is limited; if confidence improves and yield compresses to ~3.5–4.0%, price can rise materially. That gives a practical valuation (yield) multiplier of roughly ~0.93× to ~1.33× over 3 years (stubbornly high yield vs meaningful compression), which paired with dividend growth implies a price path that can be strong but needs an unusually large yield compression to hit a clean 2×.

## 4) Final conclusion (1 paragraphs total)

Triangulating the three anchors, the most likely 3-year stock price multiplier for goeasy looks roughly **~1.4× to ~1.8×**, with a midpoint around **~1.6×**: the P/E anchor says the valuation is already depressed enough to allow upside if credit stabilizes, but a conservative EPS path is more like ~1.33×–1.56× plus only partial re-rating; the P/B anchor similarly supports solid upside if ROE and de-risking persist, but a full “premium” P/B jump is not something to underwrite conservatively; and the dividend-yield anchor implies that doubling requires unusually aggressive yield compression that typically needs a multi-quarter “all-clear” on credit and regulation. **2× within ~3 years is Borderline**—plausible only if (1) credit losses trend better than a cautious cycle view, (2) funding spreads don’t worsen, (3) loan growth stays healthy without loosening underwriting, and (4) the market re-rates the stock toward ~11–12× earnings / ~2.1× book (or yield compresses toward ~3%); without most of those going right together, the base case is “strong but not double.”
