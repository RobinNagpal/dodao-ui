# Akala: Empowering Students to Navigate the College Admissions Journey

As the path to higher education becomes increasingly competitive and complex, many students find themselves overwhelmed by the college admissions process. This is where Akala, an innovative platform, steps in to ease the journey. Akala combines technology with personalized mentoring to guide students through every step of their college application process, from as early as seventh grade.

Backed by some of the most reputable names in education and technology, including USC, Google, and Techstars, Akala is helping students achieve their dreams of college admission while ensuring the process is as stress-free as possible. The platform has already demonstrated significant success, generating over $1.1 million in revenue with an impressive 300% year-over-year growth.

Currently, Akala is looking to expand further through a crowdfunding round, raising $200,000 with a valuation cap of $7 million.

## The Team Behind Akala: A Strong Foundation for Growth

Akala’s team includes individuals with diverse and relevant backgrounds in education and technology. Perry Kalmus, the founder of Akala, holds a degree from Williams College and has led the platform’s development. Debon Lewis has experience founding charter schools, and Barbara Kalmus founded the Princeton Education Network, which has helped many students gain access to higher education. Steve Helgeson’s sales experience at Kaplan also adds a valuable perspective to the team, particularly in terms of outreach and growth strategies.

While the team has substantial experience, there are areas where they could enhance their expertise, particularly in startup experience. Nevertheless, the team's combined knowledge provides a solid base to support Akala’s development in the EdTech sector.

## The Team Behind Akala: A Strong Foundation for Growth

Akala’s growth has been notable, with the company generating over $1.1 million in revenue and experiencing a 300% year-over-year growth rate. Additionally, the platform has a 76% close rate on parent consultations, indicating strong customer interest and effective sales strategies. Testimonials from parents and students further suggest that the platform's services are well-received, validating its market presence.

The platform’s partnerships with organizations like Google, USC, and Techstars also contribute to its credibility, reinforcing the trust placed in Akala by key industry players.

## Market Opportunity: A Large and Growing Sector

The college admissions guidance market is valued at $5 billion, and Akala is positioned within a significant share of that market. With a Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) of $500 million, Akala has room to grow and capture additional market share. The platform’s combination of AI and personalized guidance sets it apart from established players like Khan Academy and Coursera, making it an interesting option for students navigating the college admissions process.

While Akala faces competition, its unique value proposition and backing from major organizations help it stand out in the crowded EdTech landscape.

## Valuation and Financial Insights

The company’s current valuation cap of $7 million is based on its revenue growth, customer traction, and overall market potential. With projections indicating $2 million in revenue for the next year and conservative growth rates over the next three to five years, the valuation appears to reflect Akala’s current position in the market.

In terms of profitability, Akala is expected to see increasing profit margins, reaching 40% by year five. However, the company’s fund utilization efficiency and the clarity of its fund allocation plans will need to be optimized to support sustainable growth in the future.

Akala’s financial health is strong, with significant revenue growth to date. However, its runway of approximately 4.5 months, though manageable, is shorter than ideal for a startup in the EdTech space. This indicates a need for careful financial planning moving forward.
