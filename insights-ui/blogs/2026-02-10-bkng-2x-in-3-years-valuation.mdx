# Can Booking Holdings Stock Double in 3 Years? (BKNG)

## Overall analysis

Online travel should keep expanding over the next three years because consumers continue shifting planning and booking online, and Booking remains one of the best-positioned platforms for accommodations at global scale. But the business is still economically sensitive: travel is a “nice-to-have” spend that can slow quickly in a downturn, and competitive pressure (OTAs, hotels pushing direct, and Google’s role in travel discovery) never really goes away. Booking’s trajectory is strong because it converts a large share of revenue into free cash flow and has used that cash to shrink share count aggressively, which boosts per-share compounding. The investor mood is closer to “quality compounder” than “hype,” and the stock already carries a premium valuation versus its own near-term history as the post-COVID rebound matured. That matters because the easiest path to 2× is usually “fundamentals growth plus some rerating,” and rerating is harder when you start from an already-high multiple. The single biggest reason 2× is hard for BKNG is that a mature, mega-cap travel leader typically needs either mid-teens annual fundamental growth _and_ a friendlier multiple, or a new profit-pool expansion story that is bigger than what’s already priced in.

Revenue $6.8B (2020) → $11.0B (2021) → $17.1B (2022) → $21.4B (2023) → $23.7B (2024); FCF -$0.2B → $2.5B → $6.2B → $7.0B → $7.9B; shares ~41M → ~41M → ~40M → ~36M → ~34M.

## PRIMARY framework: EV-to-Free-Cash-Flow (EV/FCF)

### Anchor selection + baseline

EV/FCF is the best primary anchor for Booking because the company’s “real product” for shareholders is dependable, high-margin cash generation that can be redeployed into buybacks (and now dividends) while maintaining a moderate leverage profile. Using FY 2024 as the clean baseline, Booking generated about $7.9B of free cash flow on about $23.7B of revenue (roughly one-third FCF margin), and it traded around ~21× EV/FCF (about a ~4.8% FCF yield) in that period. Importantly, that multiple has already expanded meaningfully from the more normal post-recovery levels (FY 2022 EV/FCF was in the low-teens), which signals the market has already “recognized” the quality and rebound.

### 2× hurdle vs likely path

To double in three years, the stock needs roughly a 26% per-year price gain, which is far more than what most mature, high-quality large caps deliver without either a major growth acceleration or a valuation tailwind. In plain terms, if the valuation multiple stays flat, per-share free cash flow would need to rise by roughly 2× over three years, which would imply something like mid-20% annual compounding in per-share cash generation.

Under an EV/FCF lens, a 2× outcome can come from three buckets: total free cash flow growing strongly, the market paying a higher EV/FCF multiple, and per-share effects from buybacks (or leverage changes that make buybacks larger). For example, if total FCF grows about 12% per year (about ~1.40× over three years) and the company reduces shares by about 4% per year (about ~1.12× per-share lift), you only get to roughly ~1.57× before any multiple change. That means you would still need a noticeable rerating to get to 2×, which is difficult when the starting EV/FCF is already high.

Booking’s history supports strong cash generation, but the growth rate is likely to normalize from the post-pandemic rebound. The most realistic “next-three-years” drivers under this anchor are mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth as travel demand grows with the economy, steady-to-slightly-better operating efficiency (especially marketing efficiency as direct traffic improves), and FCF margins that remain very strong but don’t expand endlessly because competition forces ongoing spend. Put together, a reasonable base-case is total FCF growing about ~8% to ~12% per year (about ~1.26× to ~1.40× over three years), with buybacks adding another ~2% to ~5% per year of per-share lift depending on how aggressively management chooses to lever for repurchases while also paying dividends.

The gap is that 2× usually requires either total FCF closer to ~15% per year (about ~1.52× over three years) _and_ continued heavy buybacks, or a meaningful rerating, or both. Starting from ~21× EV/FCF, a rerating large enough to matter typically needs a clear “new level” of growth durability or an unusually supportive rate environment. Net: fundamentals ~1.26× to ~1.40×; valuation ~0.90× to ~1.05×; per-share ~1.07× to ~1.15×; total ~1.21× to ~1.69×. 2× needs a combination of above-history FCF growth and a higher-than-today EV/FCF multiple that is hard to justify without a step-change in growth or sentiment.

### Outcome under this anchor

A grounded base case is total FCF compounding at about ~10% per year, which is about ~1.33× over three years: that assumes travel demand grows steadily, Booking maintains its strong take economics, and marketing/tech spend stays efficient enough to hold FCF margins around the low-30% range rather than compress. The low end looks like ~7% FCF growth (~1.23×) if a downturn hits travel demand or if acquisition costs rise (paid search or competitive discounting), while the high end looks like ~12–14% (~1.40× to ~1.48×) if connected-trip cross-sell and payments improve monetization while demand stays robust.

On valuation, starting from a high EV/FCF, the most realistic outcome is “roughly flat to modest compression,” because mature leaders typically don’t sustain rising multiples unless growth accelerates. That suggests something like a mild headwind to mild tailwind (~0.90× to ~1.05×). Per-share effects should remain supportive but likely smaller than the last two years because the stock price is higher and dividends now absorb some cash return; a reasonable per-share lift is ~1.07× to ~1.15× over three years, depending on whether buybacks run closer to low single-digit or mid single-digit percent annually and how much incremental debt is used to fund them. Putting this together gives a base-case 3-year price multiplier of about ~1.50×, with a defensible range of ~1.30× to ~1.75×.

Using CURRENT_PRICE = $4,325.47 (Feb 10, 2026), the base-case implied 3-year price is about $6,488, and the implied 3-year price range is about $5,623 to $7,570 under this EV/FCF anchor.

## CROSS-CHECK framework #1: EV-to-Revenue (EV/Revenue)

### Anchor selection + baseline

EV/Revenue is a useful cross-check for Booking because, in a platform-like OTA model, the market often prices perceived growth durability and competitive intensity through the revenue multiple, especially when margins are already high and stable. On FY 2024 numbers, Booking traded around ~7× EV/Revenue, up from the mid-single-digit range when the recovery was earlier (FY 2022 was under ~4.5× and FY 2023 was around ~5.8×). That tells you valuation has already moved “up the quality curve,” so a lot of optimism about durable growth and resilience is embedded.

### 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× outcome over three years implies that, if the EV/Revenue multiple stayed unchanged, revenue would effectively need to double, which is not a realistic base case for a company already above $20B of revenue in a mature travel category. Therefore, under this anchor, 2× needs a combination of solid revenue growth, continued or improved profitability perception (to justify the multiple), and meaningful per-share lift from buybacks.

For EV/Revenue to support 2×, you’d need something like revenue growing ~10% per year (~1.33× over three years), buybacks adding ~1.10×, and then still require the multiple to expand from ~7× toward something closer to ~9× to bridge the remaining gap. That kind of multiple is possible in “peak optimism” periods, but it is not a normal expectation for a mature travel leader unless the market believes Booking’s growth runway has lengthened materially.

Looking at company history, revenue growth has already cooled as the rebound matured: FY 2023 was a strong recovery year, while FY 2024 was a more normal “growth plus normalization” year. A realistic three-year revenue path is high single-digit growth (~6% to ~9% per year, or ~1.19× to ~1.30× over three years), driven by steady global travel demand and ongoing online penetration, partially offset by competitive pressure and the fact that alternative accommodations and flights don’t necessarily expand revenue at the same profitability as the core lodging mix. Under this anchor, the key reality is that Booking already has very high monetization and scale, so revenue growth is more bounded by the macro travel pie than by “new market creation.”

The gap is that 2× would require either materially faster revenue growth than the company’s near-term normalized path, or a rerating that’s hard to justify at today’s already-elevated revenue multiple. Net: fundamentals ~1.19× to ~1.30×; valuation ~0.85× to ~1.10×; per-share ~1.07× to ~1.15×; total ~1.08× to ~1.64×. 2× needs a “best of all worlds” setup: strong travel demand, clear incremental monetization, and an enthusiasm-driven multiple expansion from an already rich starting point.

### Outcome under this anchor

A realistic base case is revenue growing about ~8% per year, or about ~1.26× over three years, because Booking is already a scaled leader and the category tends to grow with global travel volumes rather than explode. The low end is closer to ~1.19× if macro slows or if competition forces more promotions that shift mix and reduce net revenue growth, while the high end is closer to ~1.30× if travel demand is strong and Booking captures share via better conversion and cross-sell.

Valuation is the harder part: when EV/Revenue is already near the high end of the recent band, the more normal outcome is flat to slightly down unless investors believe the business has become structurally less cyclical or more defensible. That suggests ~0.90× to ~1.00× as the most typical, with ~1.10× requiring a notably more optimistic market. Per-share lift from buybacks remains a support (~1.07× to ~1.15×), but it’s unlikely to be enough to turn a bounded revenue story into a 2× price story on its own. This produces a base-case price multiplier around ~1.45×, with a defensible range of ~1.25× to ~1.65×.

Using CURRENT_PRICE = $4,325.47, that implies a base-case 3-year price around $6,272 and a 3-year price range of about $5,407 to $7,137 under the EV/Revenue cross-check.

## CROSS-CHECK framework #2: Price-to-Earnings (P/E)

### Anchor selection + baseline

P/E works as the second cross-check because Booking is now a highly profitable, cash-generative mega-cap where the market often values the stock as a “high-quality compounder” rather than a pure travel cyclicality play. On FY 2024 earnings, the stock traded around ~28× earnings, and this is after earnings have already recovered strongly from the pandemic period. The key context is that P/E is not just a company story; it also reflects macro discount rates and “quality premium” sentiment, which can move independently of near-term business execution.

### 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× price outcome in three years means either EPS roughly doubling if the P/E stays flat, or EPS rising meaningfully plus a P/E expansion. Put differently, if the market continues to pay around the same ~high-20s multiple, then per-share earnings need to compound at roughly the same ~26% per year as the stock price, which is not a typical expectation for a mature travel leader outside of a rebound phase.

To make 2× work under P/E, you’d likely need something like EPS growing ~15% per year (about ~1.52× over three years) and the P/E expanding from ~28× toward the mid-30s. That can happen, but it usually requires a mix of unusually strong growth visibility and a supportive market regime (lower rates, higher appetite for paying up for quality). Alternatively, you’d need EPS growth closer to ~20% per year, which is a very high bar for Booking once the recovery effect is behind it.

Historically, Booking’s EPS growth in the last couple of years has been boosted by recovery and share count reduction, and it has also benefited from very high margins. The more realistic forward setup is that revenue grows mid-to-high single digits, margins stay high but don’t expand dramatically, and buybacks add a few points to EPS growth. That points to EPS growth of roughly ~10% to ~15% per year (about ~1.33× to ~1.52× over three years), with the lower end in a softer travel macro and the upper end if demand stays strong and buybacks remain aggressive.

The gap is that even the high end of “reasonable EPS growth” still needs either a friendly rerating or no compression at all to reach 2×, and starting at ~28× makes a big rerating less likely than for a stock starting at a mid-teens multiple. Net: fundamentals ~1.33× to ~1.52×; valuation ~0.85× to ~1.10×; per-share ~1.00× to ~1.05×; total ~1.13× to ~1.75×. 2× needs either sustained EPS compounding above the normalized range or a valuation environment that pushes the P/E meaningfully higher from an already premium baseline.

### Outcome under this anchor

A grounded base case is EPS growing about ~12% per year, or roughly ~1.40× over three years, because Booking can still grow bookings and keep very strong profitability, and buybacks provide a steady per-share tailwind. The low end is ~1.33× if growth slows and buybacks moderate, while the high end is ~1.52× if demand stays strong and capital returns stay aggressive.

Valuation is the swing piece in this anchor: P/E multiples tend to compress when investors demand more “certainty” or when discount rates rise, and expand when the market rewards durable compounders. Starting at ~28×, the most realistic is flat to modest compression (~0.90× to ~1.00×), while a bullish tailwind case might be ~1.10× if rates fall and investors pay up for quality again. Per-share effects beyond what’s already embedded in EPS are modest here (because EPS is already per-share), but net debt and interest costs can still matter: if more buybacks are debt-funded, incremental interest expense can offset some EPS benefits and can cap the P/E. This yields a base-case 3-year price multiplier around ~1.45×, with a defensible range of ~1.25× to ~1.70×.

Using CURRENT_PRICE = $4,325.47, that implies a base-case 3-year price around $6,272 and a 3-year price range of about $5,407 to $7,353 under the P/E cross-check.

## Final conclusion

Triangulating the three anchors, the most likely 3-year stock price multiplier for Booking Holdings is about **~1.35× to ~1.70×**, with a midpoint around **~1.52×**, because the company can plausibly compound fundamentals in the low-teens range and add a per-share tailwind from buybacks, but it starts from an already premium valuation that limits the odds of a big rerating. In simple decomposition terms, the midpoint looks like **fundamentals ~1.30× to ~1.40×**, **valuation ~0.95× to ~1.05×**, and **per-share ~1.08× to ~1.14×**, which naturally lands below 2× unless both growth and valuation go unusually right together. The explicit 2× verdict is **Unlikely** in a realistic base case, because 2× needs a combination of sustained mid-teens fundamental growth plus either continued heavy buybacks or a multiple expansion from an already-high starting point. The single swing factor that would most change the answer is **whether Booking can sustain a clear step-up in durable growth (not just a cycle) while keeping marketing efficiency strong enough to hold FCF margins and justify a higher multiple**. Using **CURRENT_PRICE = $4,325.47 (Feb 10, 2026)**, the midpoint implied 3-year price is about **$6,575**, and the implied 3-year price range is about **$5,839 to $7,353**—in plain English: **a ~1.52× midpoint maps to ~$6.6k, while ~1.35× to ~1.70× maps to roughly ~$5.8k to ~$7.35k**.
