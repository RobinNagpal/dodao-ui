## 0) Overall analysis

ACV Auctions sits in a market that is likely _stable-to-modestly growing_ in units over a 3-year window, but cyclical in pricing and dealer behavior, so upside depends more on share gains and service attach than on the industry “lifting all boats.” Management itself framed 2025 dealer wholesale market volumes as approximately flat, with ACV aiming to grow via share gains and margin expansion. Investor interest looks **skeptical rather than euphoric**: the stock is down sharply over the last year and volatility is high, which usually means the market is still demanding proof of durable profitability. The good news is ACV has a real scaling story (marketplace units and revenue up strongly in FY2024, with FY2025 guidance calling for another 20%+ revenue growth and much higher Adjusted EBITDA). The biggest reason **2× is hard** is that ACV is still GAAP-loss-making on an LTM basis, and ongoing stock-based compensation implies continued dilution unless buybacks offset it—so you need both operational progress _and_ the market to reward it with a higher multiple.

## 1) PRIMARY framework / anchor: EV/Sales (LTM Revenue)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/Sales is the best primary anchor because ACV is still in the “prove the model” phase where the market mostly prices the business off revenue scale and confidence in eventual operating leverage, not current earnings. As of **Feb 10, 2026**, ACVA trades around **$7.54**, with **enterprise value $1.21B** and **EV/Sales 1.64** on **LTM revenue $735M**. Historically, this stock has seen far higher valuation regimes (peak price in 2021 was much higher than today), which matters because it tells you rerating is possible—but not automatic. Versus the closest public “wholesale auction marketplace” peer, **OPENLANE (OPLN) is around 2.5× EV/Sales**, while ACV sits well below that, reflecting the profitability gap and higher uncertainty.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

To double in 3 years, you need about **26% per year** compounded (because 2× over 3 years is not “just” 20%/yr). In plain terms, either ACV’s revenue per share has to compound very fast, or the valuation multiple has to rise meaningfully, or both—while dilution and any net-cash shrinkage don’t eat the gains.

Under EV/Sales, a clean way to see the hurdle is: if the EV/Sales multiple stays roughly where it is (1.6×), then **revenue (per share) would need to get close to 2×** to get the stock close to 2×—which is hard if the broader dealer wholesale market is flat and growth must come from share gains plus services. If revenue grows more realistically by 40%–70% over 3 years, then **you still need a rerating** (for example, EV/Sales moving from 1.6× to 2.2×–2.6×) _and_ dilution not getting worse.

Based on company history and management’s own near-term framing, the most likely revenue path is **mid-teens annual growth**, not persistent 25%–30% annual growth. FY2024 revenue grew 32%, and FY2025 guidance implied 20%–23% growth, but management also said the overall dealer wholesale market is expected to be roughly flat in 2025—so sustained high growth depends on continued share gains and attach of services rather than a booming market. A reasonable 3-year revenue outcome is **12%–18% per year**, which is about **1.40× to 1.64×** over 3 years. Dilution has recently been real (shares outstanding up **3.4% YoY**), and stock-based comp is still large, so a fair per-share headwind assumption is **2%–4% shares per year** (about **0.90× to 0.94×** per-share multiplier over 3 years unless buybacks fully offset).

Putting required vs likely together: the base reality is that **fundamentals alone probably don’t get you to 2×** under this anchor—you need at least some multiple recovery toward peer-like levels, and dilution must stay controlled. Net: fundamentals 1.40× to 1.64×; valuation 0.80× to 1.50×; per-share 0.90× to 1.00×; total 0.97× to 2.55×. 2× needs a rerating to roughly the low-to-mid 2× EV/Sales area plus sustained mid-to-high teens growth, with dilution closer to the low end of recent history.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A grounded base case is: revenue grows about **15% per year** (about **1.52×** over 3 years) because ACV continues to gain share and attach services even if the overall market is not expanding much, consistent with management’s “share gains + margin expansion” posture. In that case, valuation does not need to return to “2021-style” exuberance; it just needs some confidence back. If EV/Sales moves from about **1.6× to 2.0×–2.2×**, that’s a **1.2×–1.35×** valuation tailwind—still below OPENLANE’s 2.5× EV/Sales, so not a heroic assumption if profitability improves.

Per-share, I assume dilution remains a drag of roughly **0.94×** over 3 years (about 2% per year net), with net cash roughly neutral (today’s EV vs market cap implies a modest net-cash position, but not large enough to drive the equity story). That combination yields a base-case 3-year multiplier of about **1.7×**, with a defensible range of **1.0× to 2.6×** under this EV/Sales lens. Using **the current price of $7.54**, that implies an estimated 3-year price of **$12.76** (base case), with a range of **$7.33 to $19.23**.

## 2) CROSS-CHECK framework / anchor #1: EV/Gross Profit

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/Gross Profit is a genuinely different lens because it focuses on whether ACV’s mix shift (marketplace + “other marketplace” services + assurance/data) is translating into more gross profit dollars—not just more revenue dollars. This matters for ACV because the market will rerate the stock more readily when it believes incremental volume is producing scalable gross profit that can cover fixed costs. On an LTM basis, ACV shows **gross profit $213M** and EV is about **$1.21B**, implying **EV/Gross Profit of roughly 5.7×**. Importantly, management has highlighted ongoing margin expansion and targets to improve “revenue margin” over time, which is the core setup for this anchor.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× outcome in 3 years still means 26% per year, but under EV/Gross Profit you can get there with a different mix: gross profit can grow faster than revenue if margin expands, and then the market may reward it with a higher EV/GP multiple as profitability becomes more believable.

For this anchor, the “2× path” usually needs **two things at once**: gross profit up meaningfully (through both scale and margin) _and_ the EV/GP multiple not staying stuck at a distressed level. For example, if gross profit rises about **1.7×–2.0×** in 3 years, then even a modest multiple move (say **1.2×–1.4×**) can get you near 2×—but only if dilution doesn’t negate it.

History gives you the key clue: ACV’s gross profit dollars have already shown the ability to expand quickly when revenue accelerates and gross margin improves, and management is explicitly guiding to much higher Adjusted EBITDA in 2025, which is usually downstream of improved gross profit and operating leverage. It’s still realistic to assume margin improvement slows as the company scales, so a reasonable 3-year gross profit growth band is **1.4× to 2.0×**, rather than assuming a straight-line continuation of the best year. The per-share headwind remains similar: shares outstanding have been rising, and stock-based comp remains large enough that you should assume **0.90× to 0.94×** per-share impact unless buybacks grow materially.

The gap analysis here is more “option-like” than EV/Sales: gross profit growth plus a small rerating can do a lot, but it’s sensitive to execution. Net: fundamentals 1.40× to 2.00×; valuation 0.85× to 1.50×; per-share 0.90× to 1.00×; total 1.07× to 3.00×. 2× needs margin expansion to keep pushing gross profit up faster than revenue and some investor confidence that those gross profits will translate into sustained profitability (not just temporary mix or working-capital noise).

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A realistic base case is gross profit grows about **1.7×** over three years: that can come from revenue compounding in the mid-teens and a few points of gross margin expansion as higher-value services attach more consistently and unit economics improve. Management’s own outlook (strong revenue growth in 2025 alongside much higher Adjusted EBITDA) supports the idea that gross profit is scaling faster than fixed costs, even if GAAP profits lag. If that happens, a modest valuation normalization is plausible: EV/Gross Profit moving from roughly 5–6× to 6–7× (not aggressive for a scaling marketplace) is a **1.1×–1.3×** tailwind, rather than requiring anything like the earlier-cycle extremes.

Keeping the per-share drag at around **0.94×** (continued dilution partially offset by buybacks) produces a base-case 3-year multiplier of about **1.84×**, with a single-range outcome of **1.1× to 3.0×** under this lens. Using **the current price of $7.54**, that maps to **$13.86** (base case), with a range of **$8.08 to $22.62**.

## 3) CROSS-CHECK framework / anchor #2: EV/FCF (Free Cash Flow yield)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/FCF is the most conservative cross-check because it asks a simple question: “Is ACV producing repeatable cash that equity holders can actually own, after reinvestment?” This is crucial for ACV because the company has meaningful stock-based compensation, and cash flow can be flattered by working capital swings—so you want to see whether FCF becomes durable as the business matures. Today’s snapshot shows **EV/FCF 15×** (and P/FCF is similar), implying the market currently believes ACV has meaningful LTM FCF relative to its valuation. But management’s own non-GAAP framing excludes very large stock-based compensation, which is an economic cost that often shows up as dilution rather than cash expense—so per-share outcomes matter a lot under this anchor.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× outcome in EV/FCF terms typically requires either FCF to roughly double with the multiple staying steady, or FCF to grow strongly and the market to pay a higher multiple because it trusts the cash flows. In plain English: you need ACV to turn “FCF that exists” into “FCF that persists,” and you need dilution to stop eating a big part of that ownership.

The hurdle is especially strict here because ACV’s historical FCF has swung around (positive in some years, negative in others), which is often what happens when working capital and investment timing move around faster than underlying profitability. In those situations, the market is slow to award a premium EV/FCF multiple until it sees consistency across cycles.

The likely path is that FCF improves as Adjusted EBITDA rises (management guided to a large step-up in 2025 Adjusted EBITDA), but the _quality_ of that FCF matters. If FCF growth is driven mainly by sustainable unit economics and operating leverage, you can model **1.4×–2.0×** FCF growth over three years; if it’s driven by one-off working capital timing, the next down-cycle can reverse it. Meanwhile, dilution risk is “structural” unless SBC falls sharply or repurchases increase, because the company itself guided to large SBC levels in its non-GAAP bridge.

So the gap is: EV/FCF can justify 2×, but it demands cleaner execution than EV/Sales does. Net: fundamentals 1.20× to 2.00×; valuation 0.70× to 1.40×; per-share 0.90× to 1.00×; total 0.76× to 2.80×. 2× needs FCF to become clearly repeatable (not just timing) and dilution to run closer to the low end of recent experience.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A grounded base case is FCF grows about **1.6×** over three years as Adjusted EBITDA expands and capex remains modest, but the multiple does not expand much because investors remain cautious until GAAP profitability is closer and dilution moderates. Management’s 2025 outlook implies real operating progress, but the SBC scale means per-share ownership still leaks unless repurchases offset it. That leads to a “steady multiple” assumption (valuation 1.0×) and a per-share drag of 0.94×.

Under those inputs, the base-case price multiplier is about **1.5×**, with a defensible range of **0.76× to 2.8×** because cash flow outcomes can diverge a lot depending on cycle and working capital. Using **the current price of $7.54**, that implies **$11.34** (base case), with a range of **$5.70 to $21.11**.

## 4) Final conclusion

Triangulating the three anchors, ACVA’s most likely 3-year outcome looks like a **1.7× midpoint** with a wide, stock-specific range of about **0.9× to 2.6×**, reflecting high volatility (beta 1.6 and a very weak recent 52-week move) and ongoing uncertainty around durable profitability and dilution. In simple decomposition terms, the “typical” path looks like fundamentals adding roughly **1.4×–1.7×**, valuation contributing **0.9×–1.4×** depending on confidence, and per-share effects shaving that by roughly **0.90×–0.95×** unless buybacks become meaningfully larger. The **2× verdict is: Borderline**—achievable if ACV sustains mid-to-high teens growth while demonstrating that margin expansion converts into durable profits/cash and dilution stays controlled, enabling a rerating toward peer-like EV/Sales levels. Using **the current price of $7.54 (Feb 10, 2026)**, the midpoint implies **$12.80** in 3 years, with an implied range of roughly **$6.80 to $19.60**. Multiplier → price translation: **1.7× maps to about $12.8, while 0.9×–2.6× maps to about $6.8–$19.6**.
