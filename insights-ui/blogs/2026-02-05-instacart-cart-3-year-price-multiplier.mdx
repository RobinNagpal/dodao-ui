## **A) Anchor selection**

For Instacart (Maplebear) today, the **PRIMARY anchor should be EV/FCF (or equivalently FCF yield)** because this is an asset-light marketplace + retail-media model that already produces meaningful, recurring free cash flow and holds substantial cash on the balance sheet. When a business has modest capex needs and strong cash generation, long-run equity returns tend to track **per-share free cash flow growth** plus whatever the market pays for that cash flow. In contrast, **P/S can mislead** because two grocery-adjacent platforms with the same sales growth can have very different cash economics depending on incentives and shopper/fulfillment costs; and **P/E can be noisy** when stock-based compensation and one-time items swing GAAP earnings (which the company itself highlights as meaningful in its non-GAAP reconciliations).

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #1 is EV/EBITDA**, because it is the cleanest operational profitability bridge between “revenue grows” and “cash flow grows.” Instacart’s model has a high gross margin profile (fees + advertising) but meaningful operating costs, so small changes in operating leverage can move EBITDA a lot. EV/EBITDA is especially informative when investors are debating whether recent margin strength is durable or partly timing/incentives, because EBITDA sits closer to the operating engine than free cash flow (which can be bumped around by working-capital timing).

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #2 is EV/Revenue (EV/Sales)**, because it catches the blind spot where cash flow (and even EBITDA) looks great in a period, but the **top-line growth rate is structurally decelerating** due to grocery maturity and competition. This second check matters for Instacart because the company’s revenue is explicitly a mix of **transaction revenue and advertising/other revenue**, and the market often “marks down” the entire franchise if growth slows—even if margins hold—by compressing EV/Sales. Using EV/Sales alongside EV/FCF helps ensure we’re not quietly assuming a growth re-acceleration that the business model may not be able to deliver in a “similar regime” environment.

## **B) The 3–4 driver framework**

**Driver 1: Revenue growth (and mix within revenue).** Instacart’s next-3-year valuation is highly sensitive to whether it can keep revenue growing at a steady low-double-digit pace or whether it drifts toward high-single-digits. The current baseline is roughly **~$3.63B TTM revenue growing ~+10%** year over year, which is already a “mature platform” growth rate rather than a hypergrowth rate. Revenue growth directly drives the **EV/Sales** anchor (since EV/Sales times revenue ≈ EV), and it also sets the foundation for EBITDA and FCF growth because an asset-light marketplace can still show operating leverage when volume increases faster than fixed costs.

**Driver 2: Operating leverage (EBITDA/EBIT margin trajectory).** The economic question is not gross margin (already high) but how much of each incremental revenue dollar drops to operating profit after incentives, shopper support, and ongoing product/enterprise investment. Recent reported profitability suggests operating margins can sit in the mid-teens in strong quarters (for example, Q3 2025 shows net income around **~15% of revenue** and adjusted EBITDA margin around **~30%**, illustrating meaningful profitability when the model is humming). This driver is the direct “engine” behind **EV/EBITDA**, and it indirectly supports **EV/FCF** because higher operating profit typically converts to higher cash generation in an asset-light model.

**Driver 3: Cash conversion (FCF margin stability vs working-capital noise).** Instacart’s free cash flow is attractive, but it is not mechanically smooth because the business has meaningful payment timing effects (weekly payouts to shoppers, collection cycles, and other operating timing items), which management explicitly notes can impact reported cash flow. That means a conservative approach should focus on **normalized FCF margin** over a few quarters rather than extrapolating a single unusually strong quarter. This driver is the core determinant of the **EV/FCF** anchor: even if revenue grows, the stock will not compound well if FCF margin compresses from higher incentives, higher support costs, or reduced ad monetization.

**Driver 4: Per-share math (net dilution vs net buybacks).** Because we care about a **stock price multiplier**, the real question is what happens to **FCF per share and EBITDA per share**, not just totals. Instacart has been an active repurchaser (for example, it repurchased **~$272M** of stock in the first nine months of 2025), while also running meaningful stock-based compensation (about **~$253M** over the same nine months), which means the net share count outcome can land anywhere from slight shrink to slight growth depending on repurchase intensity. This driver can add (or subtract) several percentage points from the 3-year multiplier even if the business performs exactly as expected operationally.

## **C) Baseline snapshot**

As of **February 4, 2026**, CART trades around the **mid-$30s** per share. The business is running at roughly **~$3.63B TTM revenue** (about **~+10%** YoY). On the balance sheet it holds substantial liquidity (cash and cash equivalents of **~$1.69B** at Sep 30, 2025, plus marketable securities), with minimal debt, which makes enterprise value meaningfully lower than market cap and is one reason EV-based anchors are more informative than equity-only anchors.

Over the last 4–5 years, revenue expanded from about **~$1.48B (2020)** to **~$3.38B (2024)**, but the growth rate has clearly decelerated (from very high post-pandemic growth to ~low-teens more recently), which is what you expect as grocery delivery penetration matures. At the same time, cash generation improved dramatically: operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2025 was **~$788M**, supported partly by non-cash stock-based comp and partly by core profitability, while the company explicitly flags that working-capital timing can swing reported cash flows quarter to quarter. The trend implication is that Instacart has achieved real operating leverage, but “repeatable low-double-digit growth” is the conservative base case rather than assuming a return to 20%+ growth.

## **D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”**

A **2×** in **3 years** requires roughly **~26% per year** compounded (because ~1.26× × ~1.26× × ~1.26× ≈ 2×). In a “broadly similar” market regime, that kind of return usually cannot come mostly from valuation expansion; it generally needs **per-share fundamentals** (FCF/share, EBITDA/share, or earnings/share) to compound at something like high-teens to mid-20s, with valuation at least stable. Put simply: if valuation multiples stay flat, then **per-share value creation has to do almost all the work**.

By anchor, the hurdle looks demanding. On **EV/FCF**, if the market keeps valuing Instacart at roughly today’s EV/FCF level, then the stock only doubles if **FCF per share is close to 2×**, which usually means total FCF nearly doubles unless share count shrinks meaningfully. On **EV/EBITDA**, the same logic applies: if EV/EBITDA stays in the same neighborhood, EBITDA per share needs to approach **~2×**, which requires a combination of revenue growth and margin expansion. On **EV/Sales**, the hurdle is even clearer in plain English math: if revenue grows ~10% per year (≈ ~1.33× over 3 years), then to reach 2× you’d still need roughly **~1.5×** of multiple expansion (because ~1.33× × ~1.5× ≈ 2×), which is hard to justify in a “similar regime” unless growth visibly re-accelerates and competitive risk fades.

What is **most likely** for the next 3 years based on company history is a continuation of the current “steady but not explosive” profile: revenue growth in a roughly **~8% to ~12%** band (consistent with ~+10% TTM and the slowing growth pattern), EBITDA/operating profitability that is broadly stable to modestly improving (because the model is already showing meaningful profitability, so further gains are more about ongoing discipline than a one-time flip), and normalized FCF margin staying healthy but not permanently at peak-quarter levels due to timing effects. On the per-share side, the most defensible expectation is **roughly flat to mildly down shares** (say ~-1% to +1% per year net), because buybacks are real but stock-based comp is also real—so per-share lift is helpful but unlikely to be massive without a deliberate step-up in repurchases.

Industry logic supports that conservative band rather than a heroic growth assumption. Grocery is a high-frequency category, but online penetration gains tend to be incremental once the early adoption wave passes, and competition from broader delivery “super-apps” creates a natural ceiling on take rate and a persistent need for promotions. The company’s own filings point to variability in key operating measures like GTV and emphasize that growth and profitability can fluctuate with strategic initiatives; for example, Q3 2025 GTV grew about **~10%** and was driven by orders with some pressure from average order value, which is exactly the “steady, competitive environment” pattern rather than a re-acceleration story. That business reality makes it plausible to maintain low-double-digit growth, but harder to assume a jump to sustained mid-teens growth without either a major category expansion or a meaningful competitive change (which we are explicitly not assuming).

Putting “required” next to “likely,” the gap is visible across all three anchors. Under **EV/FCF**, 2× usually needs **~2× FCF per share**, while a conservative path that assumes ~8–12% revenue growth and broadly stable FCF margins more naturally produces something like **~1.4× to ~1.7×** FCF per share; the remaining distance would have to come from a notably higher EV/FCF multiple. Under **EV/EBITDA**, you would again need EBITDA per share approaching **~2×**, but a realistic combination of revenue growth and modest margin improvement more often produces **~1.3× to ~1.6×**. Under **EV/Sales**, the “math” says you’d need a big multiple re-rating unless revenue growth is sustainably mid-teens, which is above what the recent run-rate suggests. Net: fundamentals imply ~**1.3× to ~1.8×**; 2× requires **a sustained mid-teens growth + margin lift + at least some multiple expansion** that is above history/industry/business reality.

## **E) Business reality check**

Operationally, the base case is achievable if Instacart keeps doing three things well at the same time: maintain steady order/GTV growth through retailer breadth and customer habit; grow higher-margin **advertising and other** revenue faster than the core transaction layer by improving ad tools and measurement for brands; and keep operating costs from rising as fast as revenue by scaling support, improving shopper/fulfillment efficiency, and being disciplined on incentives. This is the practical pathway that supports the revenue growth driver while allowing EBITDA and FCF to rise at least in line with sales (and ideally a bit faster).

The constraints are also straightforward and very real. If DoorDash/Uber-style bundling and subsidies force higher promotions, that can compress FCF even if revenue grows, breaking the EV/FCF anchor. If retailers push back on economics or shift volume to their own channels, that can slow GTV/revenue growth, breaking EV/Sales. If worker-classification or related legal/regulatory pressure raises fulfillment/support costs, it can cap margin expansion, breaking EV/EBITDA; the company explicitly calls out worker classification matters among adjustments and legal/regulatory items. Finally, even if operations are stable, cash flow can look lumpier than underlying economics due to payment timing and collection cycles, which is why extrapolating a single quarter’s FCF margin is risky.

Reconciling business logic with the numbers, the **base-case path is plausible** because it mainly requires incremental execution—steady growth, disciplined costs, and continued ad/platform traction—rather than a reinvention of the model. But the **2× path is less natural** because it needs a step-change in at least one dimension (growth re-acceleration, materially higher monetization, or a meaningful valuation re-rating) on top of already-strong profitability. In other words, Instacart can be a good compounder from here, but doubling in 3 years asks for “everything goes right” rather than “mostly steady execution.”

## **F) Multi-anchor triangulation**

### **1. Primary anchor**

Today’s EV/FCF setup is attractive on paper: the stock trades around the **mid-$30s** and the company holds significant cash (about **~$1.69B cash and equivalents** at Sep 30, 2025), which makes enterprise value materially below market cap. Using the current EV/FCF neighborhood implied by market data, you’re effectively paying a **low-double-digit multiple of free cash flow**, which is consistent with a “steady grower with competitive risk” rather than a premium growth platform.

For the 3-year inputs, a conservative set is: revenue grows **~8–12% per year** (roughly consistent with the ~+10% TTM run-rate); normalized FCF margin stays roughly **high-teens to low-20s** (healthy for asset-light, but not assuming permanent peak quarters given timing effects); and share count is roughly **flat to down slightly** (buybacks continue, but SBC continues too, as seen in the cash flow statement where repurchases and SBC are both meaningful). This is reasonable because it aligns with the business model’s strengths (asset-light, scalable ad/product layer) and constraints (competitive promotions and steady, not explosive, category growth).

Plain-English math from those inputs typically yields a **fundamental EV/FCF-driven multiplier** around **~1.3× to ~1.8×** over 3 years. The low end corresponds to ~8% revenue growth (≈ ~1.26× over 3 years) with roughly flat FCF margin and flat shares, producing FCF/share growth in the low-30% range overall; the high end corresponds to ~12% revenue growth (≈ ~1.40×) plus modest margin improvement and a small net share shrink, which can lift FCF/share toward the high-60% to ~80% range. Landing near 2× would generally require either sustained mid-teens growth (≈ ~1.52×) plus margin expansion **and** net buybacks, or a higher EV/FCF multiple than today.

### **2. Cross-check anchor #1**

On EV/EBITDA, the baseline is that Instacart is already producing substantial profitability, with filings showing strong quarterly net income margins and high adjusted EBITDA margins in recent periods, which tells you the model can throw off operating profit when volume is stable. Because cash and debt are not the main story (cash is large, debt is small), EV/EBITDA is a good way to focus on the operating engine without getting distracted by capital structure.

The 3-year inputs mirror the revenue and operating leverage story: revenue growth in the **~8–12%** band; EBITDA margin roughly **stable to modestly higher** (because the model already shows profitability, so gains are likely incremental rather than a dramatic “turn”); and per-share outcomes roughly flat to mildly positive due to buybacks offsetting SBC. This is reasonable because competitive dynamics cap how much “easy” margin expansion is available, but scale and product/ads can still create some operating leverage.

Those inputs translate to an EBITDA-driven fundamental multiplier that is usually **~1.3× to ~1.7×** over 3 years if the EV/EBITDA multiple is roughly stable. The low end is the “growth but no real margin lift” case where EBITDA grows roughly in line with sales; the high end is the case where EBITDA grows a bit faster than sales due to modest operating leverage and a small per-share tailwind. To get to 2× from this anchor, you typically need EBITDA per share approaching ~2× **or** a meaningful EV/EBITDA re-rating, and the latter is hard to bank on in a similar-regime assumption set.

### **3. Cross-check anchor #2**

On EV/Sales, the baseline is simple: Instacart is running around **~$3.63B TTM revenue**, and its enterprise value reflects a **mid-single-digit percentage of GTV economics** translated into a sales multiple that is not “bubble” high. This anchor is especially useful because the company explicitly describes revenue as a combination of transaction revenue plus advertising/other revenue (including brand advertising and SaaS-like retailer solutions), so top-line durability depends on both marketplace scale and continued ad/platform monetization.

For inputs, keep it conservative: revenue growth **~8–12%** (with the understanding that grocery is mature and competition is persistent); and assume the EV/Sales multiple is **more likely stable to slightly down** than sharply up unless growth re-accelerates, because EV/Sales is the multiple markets compress first when growth slows. The reasonableness check here is that even the company’s own discussion of GTV shows a steady, competitive pattern (for example, Q3 2025 GTV up ~10% driven by orders, with some pressure from average order value), which supports “steady growth” but not a clear re-rating catalyst.

That yields an EV/Sales-based fundamental multiplier of roughly **~1.2× to ~1.7×** over 3 years. The low end corresponds to ~8% revenue CAGR (≈ ~1.26×) with a small multiple compression (because growth is merely steady); the high end corresponds to ~12% CAGR (≈ ~1.40×) with a stable multiple if the market becomes more confident in ad/platform durability. To reach 2× on this anchor, you usually need either ~15%+ growth for multiple years (≈ ~1.52×) plus a clear multiple re-rating, or a very large multiple re-rating with only modest growth—neither of which is the conservative default.

## **G) Valuation sanity check**

Valuation looks **roughly neutral to mildly supportive**, but not something you should count on as the primary driver. The stock is currently around the mid-$30s, and operationally the business is profitable with strong cash generation and a large cash balance, which tends to put a floor under “how cheap it can look” on EV/FCF. At the same time, the market is unlikely to pay a dramatically higher EV/Sales or EV/FCF multiple unless growth visibly moves up from ~10% to sustained mid-teens and competitive pressure clearly eases—conditions that are not the conservative base case.

A conservative valuation multiplier over 3 years is therefore something like **~0.9× to ~1.2×**. The ~0.9× case is a mild de-rating if growth drifts toward high-single-digits or incentives rise; the ~1.2× case is a modest re-rating if Instacart demonstrates steady growth, durable ad monetization, and consistent FCF conversion, making the “quality compounder” narrative more accepted without requiring a regime shift.

## **H) Final answer**

The **most likely 3-year price multiplier** for CART, under conservative “similar regime” assumptions, is about **~1.3× to ~1.8×**, mainly because a realistic combination of ~8–12% revenue growth and broadly stable high-teens/low-20s free-cash-flow margins produces solid—but not doubling—per-share fundamental compounding.

A reasonable **bull-case** is **~1.8× to ~2.3×**, but it requires several things to go right simultaneously: revenue growth holds closer to **mid-teens** for multiple years (not just one quarter), advertising/other monetization continues to scale without requiring heavier incentives, operating leverage persists so FCF grows faster than revenue, and buybacks at least offset SBC so per-share economics lift meaningfully—plus you likely need **some** valuation support rather than compression.

**Borderline.** Quarterly revenue growth (% YoY); quarterly GTV growth (% YoY); quarterly orders growth (% YoY); quarterly advertising & other revenue growth (% YoY); adjusted EBITDA margin (% of revenue); GAAP operating margin (% of revenue); free cash flow margin (% of revenue, trailing 4Q); stock-based compensation ($ and % of revenue, trailing 4Q); diluted shares outstanding (% change YoY); repurchases ($ per quarter) and net cash balance ($).
