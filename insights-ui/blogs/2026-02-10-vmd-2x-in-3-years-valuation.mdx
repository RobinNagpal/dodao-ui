title: 'Can Viemed Healthcare Stock Double in 3 Years? A Simple Valuation Breakdown'
abstract: 'This article breaks down whether Viemed Healthcare (VMD) can realistically deliver 2× returns over the next three years using three non-overlapping valuation anchors: EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, and P/E. It shows what growth, margin, cash reinvestment, and valuation rerating would need to happen, and why the outcome is more borderline than a clear yes.'

## 0) Overall take on Viemed and the 2× question

Home-based respiratory care should keep expanding over the next three years because the demand is driven by aging patients, chronic disease prevalence, and payers pushing care into lower-cost settings like the home. Viemed is positioned in a “high-touch” niche (ventilation + respiratory therapist support) where switching is hard once a patient is onboarded, so the business is structurally recurring rather than cyclical. Investor interest does not look euphoric in the numbers you provided: the stock trades around a mid-single-digit EV/EBITDA and a low EV/Sales versus its own recent history, which usually signals “steady compounder with reimbursement risk,” not hype. The company’s recent trajectory is strong on revenue and EBITDA growth, but the biggest reason 2× is hard for this stock is that it must keep compounding while continuously reinvesting in equipment and clinical staff, and the market may still refuse to pay a much higher multiple due to Medicare/reimbursement uncertainty. Revenue: $117m (FY21) → $139m (FY22) → $183m (FY23) → $224m (FY24).

## 1) Primary anchor: EV/EBITDA

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/EBITDA is the best primary anchor for Viemed because it is fundamentally an equipment-rental-plus-clinical-service model where depreciation is large and free cash flow can swing with growth capex, so EBITDA usually tracks the “earning power” more cleanly than net income or short-window FCF. Using your FY 2024 figures, EBITDA was about $42.6m on $224.3m of revenue, and the valuation ratios imply an EV/EBITDA around the mid–single digits to high–single digits (roughly ~7–8× on the FY 2024 snapshot). Historically, the company has traded across a wider band (roughly high-single digits to low-double digits on your 2020–2024 ratios), which gives us a real, stock-specific reference range for rerating or derating.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× return in three years implies about ~26% per year. In plain terms, that means Viemed must either grow EBITDA per share very quickly, or the market must pay a meaningfully higher EV/EBITDA multiple than today, or both.

Under EV/EBITDA, the clean way to think about “2×” is: “How much can EBITDA grow?” times “Does the EV/EBITDA multiple rise or fall?” times “Do per-share mechanics help or hurt?” For 2×, a realistic split would look like EBITDA up ~1.6× to ~1.8× over three years plus a multiple lift of ~1.15× to ~1.30×, with a small per-share tailwind. If the multiple stays flat, EBITDA needs to be closer to ~2× by itself, which is a much tougher ask for a service-heavy model that must keep hiring and buying equipment.

Based on the company’s own history, the most likely three-year fundamentals path is “good growth, but not a straight line.” Revenue has recently grown fast (high teens to 30%+ in some years), but a grounded forward view would usually fade that to something like ~12% to ~18% per year as the base gets larger, which is about ~1.40× to ~1.64× over three years. EBITDA margin has been around the high teens to ~20% recently (roughly ~17% to ~20% in your 2022–2024 data), so a realistic range is “mostly stable,” say ~18% to ~21% depending on staffing costs and mix; that makes EBITDA growth roughly similar to revenue growth, maybe slightly better if margins hold and scale shows up. On per-share mechanics, the share count has been fairly flat overall with small changes year to year, so the most honest expectation is roughly flat to slightly dilutive (around ~0% to ~1% dilution per year), while net cash is modest relative to market cap and can help at the margin but won’t drive the whole result.

When you compare “required” versus “likely,” the gap is mainly the multiple. A likely EBITDA outcome might be ~1.45× to ~1.70× over three years, which is solid but not automatically a double. If the EV/EBITDA multiple stays around today’s level or even compresses slightly as the company matures, you do not get to 2×. Net: fundamentals ~1.45× to ~1.70×; valuation ~0.90× to ~1.20×; per-share ~0.99× to ~1.03×; total ~1.30× to ~2.10×. 2× needs conditions above history/industry/business reality: sustained high-teens growth with stable margins and at least a mild rerating toward the upper end of its own historical EV/EBITDA band.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A reasonable base case is that Viemed keeps compounding, but at a more normal rate than the last few years: think revenue growth around the mid-teens, EBITDA margin roughly stable around ~19% to ~20%, and EBITDA rising about ~16% to ~18% per year, which lands near ~1.55× to ~1.65× over three years. The low end would be a scenario where growth slows toward the low teens and wage/staffing pressure prevents margin expansion, pulling EBITDA growth closer to ~1.40× to ~1.50×; the high end is sustained high-teens growth with margins holding, pushing EBITDA closer to ~1.70×+.

On valuation, the stock already trades at a relatively modest EV/EBITDA versus its own recent band, so a small rerating is possible if investors gain confidence that growth is durable and reimbursement risk stays quiet. But the market often keeps a “policy risk discount” on Medicare-exposed models, so the safer expectation is “flat to slightly up” rather than a big jump. That suggests a valuation multiplier around ~1.00× to ~1.15× in the base case, with a downside of ~0.90× if sentiment sours, and an upside of ~1.20× if it rerates back toward the higher end of its own historical range. Per-share effects are likely small: assume share count roughly flat to slightly up (a ~0.99× to ~1.00× headwind), partially offset by modest balance sheet improvement (a ~1.00× to ~1.03× tailwind), for a net ~1.00× ish per-share multiplier.

Putting it together, this anchor supports a base-case 3-year price multiplier around ~1.75×, with a defensible range of ~1.45× to ~2.10×. With CURRENT_PRICE at $8.43, that implies a base-case 3-year price near ~$14.75 and a 3-year price range of roughly ~$12.23 to ~$17.70.

## 2) Cross-check anchor #1: EV/Sales

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/Sales is a good non-overlapping cross-check because it focuses on top-line scale and market sentiment, and then implicitly asks whether margins are “good enough” to justify a higher or lower revenue multiple. Using your FY 2024 snapshot, revenue was about $224.3m and EV/Sales is around the low-to-mid 1× range (your ratios show it near ~1.4× for FY 2024), which is also near the low end of the company’s own recent band (it has been higher in prior years in your data). This anchor is useful because it tests whether “multiple mean reversion” plus steady sales growth could do most of the work.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× in three years still means ~26% per year, but EV/Sales frames the path differently: it asks whether revenue can grow fast enough and whether investors will pay more per dollar of revenue. In this framing, you can get to 2× either through very strong sales compounding, or through a meaningful rerating of EV/Sales, or both.

To support ~2× under EV/Sales, a plausible combo would be revenue up ~1.5× to ~1.7× over three years, and EV/Sales rising from roughly ~1.4× toward something like ~1.7× to ~2.0×, with per-share effects small. That is not an “optimism-only” scenario because the multiple is currently closer to the low end of its own history, but it still requires the market to get more comfortable with the durability of the model.

What is most likely on fundamentals based on company history is still strong revenue growth, but probably moderating. A grounded range is ~12% to ~18% per year, which is about ~1.40× to ~1.64× over three years, and that range matches both the recent growth strength and the reality that growth rates usually fade as companies scale. The margin piece matters here: EV/Sales usually expands when investors believe margins are stable or improving, and shrinks when they fear price pressure or rising service costs. Viemed’s recent margins suggest it can hold healthy gross margin, but operating margins are not huge, so the honest view is “stable to modestly better,” not “margin explosion.” Per-share effects again are likely small given the share count history.

The required-versus-likely gap in this anchor is narrower than it looks because EV/Sales has already compressed versus parts of the company’s own past. A base case might be revenue ~1.5× over three years, EV/Sales roughly flat to modestly up, and per-share near flat, which lands under 2×. Net: fundamentals ~1.40× to ~1.64×; valuation ~0.95× to ~1.35×; per-share ~0.99× to ~1.03×; total ~1.32× to ~2.28×. 2× needs conditions above history/industry/business reality: growth stays in the mid-to-high teens and the market is willing to re-rate EV/Sales back toward the mid-to-upper part of its own historical band.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A reasonable base case is revenue compounding around the mid-teens, giving ~1.50× to ~1.55× over three years, while EV/Sales edges up modestly from a low-ish starting point as the company proves the model is durable and not just a short burst of growth. That points to a valuation multiplier around ~1.10× to ~1.20× in the base case, with a downside case of “multiple stays low or slips” and an upside case of “multiple mean reverts closer to its own higher historical levels.” Per-share effects are still small and likely near neutral.

This produces a base-case 3-year price multiplier around ~1.85×, with a defensible range of ~1.55× to ~2.20× under this specific lens. With CURRENT_PRICE at $8.43, that implies a base-case 3-year price near ~$15.59 and a 3-year price range of roughly ~$13.07 to ~$18.55.

## 3) Cross-check anchor #2: P/E (EPS-based)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

P/E is the third (non-overlapping) lens because it ties directly to per-share earnings power and how much the market will pay for those earnings. Using FY 2024 EPS of about $0.29 and CURRENT_PRICE of $8.43, the current P/E is roughly ~29× on that EPS base (your ratios show a similar high-20s P/E around year-end pricing). Historically in your data, P/E has swung widely, which is a reminder that this stock’s multiple can move a lot based on confidence in growth and on how “clean” earnings look in any given year.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× in three years means the stock price must compound ~26% per year, and under a P/E framing that means EPS must rise materially, or the P/E multiple must expand, or both. If the P/E multiple does not rise, EPS needs to be close to ~2× in three years to get the stock to ~2×.

For 2× to work under P/E with a realistic split, you’d want EPS up something like ~1.6× to ~1.9× plus a P/E multiple that stays roughly stable (or even rises slightly). If the P/E compresses as the company matures (which often happens when high-growth becomes “normal growth”), EPS has to do even more of the work, and that becomes a tougher hurdle.

The most likely EPS path, using the company’s own history, is “meaningful improvement but not a straight shot to a double.” EPS went from $0.16 (FY 2022) to $0.27 (FY 2023) to $0.29 (FY 2024), which shows improvement but also suggests recent EPS growth is not automatically keeping pace with revenue growth every year. A grounded forward view would assume revenue growth in the low-to-high teens and modest operating leverage, translating to EPS growth perhaps around ~12% to ~22% per year, or about ~1.40× to ~1.82× over three years. The swing factor for EPS is whether SG&A and clinical staffing scale efficiently; if they do, EPS can surprise on the upside, but if they don’t, EPS can lag even while revenue grows.

When you compare required versus likely under P/E, the problem is that the multiple may not cooperate. The market is already paying a fairly rich P/E for a company whose net margin is mid-single digits, so it is reasonable to expect the P/E to drift down if growth slows or if reimbursement anxiety rises. Net: fundamentals ~1.40× to ~1.82×; valuation ~0.75× to ~1.00×; per-share ~0.99× to ~1.03×; total ~1.04× to ~1.88×. 2× needs conditions above history/industry/business reality: EPS needs to push toward the top end of that range and the P/E must hold near today’s level instead of compressing.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A base case under P/E is EPS compounding in the mid-to-high teens, which is consistent with a steady, well-executed expansion but not an earnings “step change.” That leads to an EPS fundamentals multiplier around ~1.55× to ~1.70× over three years. The key reason not to assume a clean ~2× EPS outcome is that this model must keep reinvesting in therapists and equipment, and the accounting earnings line is more sensitive to operating cost pressure than the EBITDA line.

On the valuation side, a conservative assumption is modest multiple compression as growth normalizes, taking the P/E multiplier to something like ~0.85× to ~0.95× rather than expanding. Per-share effects should be close to neutral given the historical share count stability. Putting those together supports a base-case 3-year price multiplier around ~1.65×, with a defensible range of ~1.35× to ~1.95×. With CURRENT_PRICE at $8.43, that implies a base-case 3-year price near ~$13.91 and a 3-year price range of roughly ~$11.38 to ~$16.44.

## 4) Final conclusion

Triangulating the three anchors, the most likely 3-year multiplier for Viemed looks like ~1.8×, with a tighter realistic range of ~1.5× to ~2.1×. In plain decomposition terms, a reasonable midpoint is fundamentals around ~1.55× to ~1.65× (driven by continued mid-teens growth and mostly stable EBITDA margins), valuation around ~1.05× to ~1.15× (some room for rerating from a low-ish EV/Sales and modest EV/EBITDA, but limited by reimbursement/policy discount), and per-share effects around ~1.00× (share count roughly flat and balance sheet not large enough to dominate). The explicit 2× verdict is Borderline: it is achievable, but it likely requires sustained high-teens growth plus at least a mild rerating, not just “steady execution.” The single swing factor that would most likely change the answer is whether the market becomes more confident that reimbursement risk stays contained while Viemed proves it can scale its clinical workforce without margin leakage. With CURRENT_PRICE at $8.43 (as provided), the midpoint implies a 3-year price of about ~$15.17 and the range implies roughly ~$12.65 to ~$17.70, meaning “~1.8× most likely” translates to “about $15 in three years,” while the realistic band is “low-$13s to high-$17s.”
