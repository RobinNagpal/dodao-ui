# Decoding REIT Performance: The Critical Roles of AFFO and FFO


## Introduction

When evaluating a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), traditional metrics like Earnings Per Share (EPS) and the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio often fall short in capturing the true cash-generating power of these companies. 

In this article, we focus exclusively on Funds from Operations (FFO) and Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO), using FVR as an example, to illustrate how these metrics offer a more accurate insight into a REIT’s operational performance.

We begin by defining FFO and AFFO and outlining their calculation, then delve into why depreciation and other non-cash charges can distort net income, making EPS and P/E unreliable for REIT analysis. Using charts and tables, we compare the behavior of traditional metrics versus FFO and AFFO, highlighting the enhanced clarity these measures provide regarding dividend sustainability and overall financial health. 

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates why FFO and AFFO are essential tools for investors seeking to understand and evaluate REIT performance.


## Background

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) have become a favored investment vehicle, allowing individuals to gain exposure to income-producing properties without the hassles of direct property management. Traditionally, companies are assessed using metrics like **EPS** and the **P/E ratio**, which work well for standard corporate evaluations. However, REITs operate under a different financial framework that challenges the effectiveness of these conventional measures.

To better capture the **economic reality** of REIT operations, the industry has embraced alternative metrics such as **Funds from Operations (FFO)** and **Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)**. FFO improves upon traditional metrics by adding back **non-cash charges** like depreciation and amortization, and by excluding gains from property sales. This adjustment provides a clearer picture of the REIT’s ongoing operational performance. AFFO goes one step further by deducting **recurring capital expenditures** necessary for maintaining and enhancing the property portfolio, offering an even more refined measure of the REIT’s sustainable cash flow.


## Key Accounting Adjustments and Pitfalls in REIT Analysis



1. Why Depreciation Is Not Ideal for Real Estate

Depreciation is an accounting principle designed to capture the declining value of physical assets over time, but its application to **real estate** can be misleading. Unlike machinery or equipment, well-maintained real estate properties often hold or even **increase in value**, rather than depreciate in the traditional sense. Applying standard depreciation schedules to real estate artificially **lowers reported net income**, creating a disconnect between the property’s accounting-based earnings and its **true cash-generating capacity**. This gap can be especially pronounced in **long-lived assets** like commercial and residential buildings, where regular maintenance and improvements extend their useful life indefinitely. Consequently, using depreciation in real estate tends to **understate a property’s economic value**, potentially skewing critical performance metrics for investors.


### The Impact of Non-Cash Charges on Net Income

Depreciation and amortization are accounting entries that do not involve **actual cash outflows** but can significantly lower a company’s **reported net income**. In the context of real estate, where properties often retain or appreciate in value, these non-cash charges can **exaggerate** the decline in an asset’s worth. As a result, relying solely on net income can obscure a REIT’s true operating performance, since depreciation and amortization reduce reported profits without diminishing the REIT’s **actual cash-generating capacity**. This misalignment highlights why many real estate analysts prefer **cash flow–based metrics**, such as FFO and AFFO, which adjust for these non-cash items to better reflect the ongoing health and **earnings potential** of a property portfolio.



2. Gains on Sale of Property

While selling properties at a profit can bolster a REIT’s net income, these **gains on sale** are typically **non-recurring** and may not reflect the REIT’s ongoing ability to generate **rental income**. A single large sale can significantly inflate net income in a given period, potentially masking weaker operational performance. For this reason, industry-standard metrics such as FFO and AFFO **exclude gains on property sales**, focusing instead on the **recurring cash flow** from rental operations. By removing these one-time events, investors gain a clearer view of a REIT’s **long-term earnings potential** and **dividend sustainability**.



3. Recurring Capital Expenses

Real estate assets require regular maintenance, updates, and improvements to remain competitive and **retain their value**. These **recurring capital expenses** can include everything from minor repairs and refurbishments to tenant improvements and common-area renovations. Unlike depreciation—an accounting allocation that doesn’t involve a direct cash outlay—these expenditures **directly reduce** a REIT’s available cash. Metrics such as **AFFO** subtract these recurring costs from FFO to provide a more accurate assessment of the **sustainable cash flow** available for dividends and growth initiatives. Ignoring these expenses can overstate a REIT’s financial health, leading investors to draw **overly optimistic** conclusions about its long-term profitability.


## Why EPS and P/E Ratio Are Not Enough for REIT Analysis

**Earnings Per Share (EPS)** is a commonly used metric that divides a company’s **net income** by the number of outstanding shares, offering a snapshot of per-share profitability.

The **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio**, in turn, compares a company’s share price to its EPS, helping investors quickly gauge whether a stock is relatively expensive or cheap. While these measures are vital in traditional equity analysis, they can be misleading for Real Estate Investment Trusts (**REITs**) due to **depreciation**—a non-cash expense that lowers net income, even though real estate assets often retain or appreciate in value with proper upkeep. Consequently, **EPS** is **artificially deflated**, leading to distorted **P/E ratios** that undervalue a REIT’s actual cash-generating ability. By contrast, **Funds from Operations (FFO)** adjusts for this discrepancy by **adding back depreciation**, providing a clearer view of a REIT’s operational performance and its capacity to generate sustainable dividends for investors.

The image below highlights how FVR determines its **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** by dividing **net income** by the **number of shares outstanding**, and then uses that EPS to compute the **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio**—a classic, though sometimes less REIT-specific, valuation measure.

![EPS Calculation](/images/blogs/decoding-reit-performance-the-critical-roles-of-affo-and-ffo/income-statement-for-eps.png)

A negative **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** means that FVR reported a net loss rather than a profit in the accounting period under review. For **REITs**, this negative result can be heavily influenced by **non-cash depreciation** charges, which reduce reported earnings even though they may not impact the REIT’s actual cash flow. As such, a negative EPS for a REIT does not necessarily imply weak cash-generating ability; instead, it highlights why investors often rely on metrics like **FFO** and **AFFO**, which adjust for depreciation and other non-cash items to provide a clearer picture of the REIT’s ongoing operational performance.


### Price to Earnings Ratio

Market price of FVR share = $17.46 (on 25th Feb, 2025)

EPS = -$0.22

P/E Ratio = Price per Share / Earnings per Share 

P/E Ratio = -79.36

A negative P/E ratio arises when **EPS** (Earnings Per Share) is below zero, indicating that the company (in this case, FVR) reported a net loss for the period. In the context of **REITs**, this negative figure often reflects substantial **non-cash depreciation** and other accounting adjustments, rather than a true lack of cash flow. As a result, a negative P/E typically **does not** provide a meaningful measure of the REIT’s valuation or performance. This is why analysts turn to **cash flow–based metrics**—such as **FFO** and **AFFO**—which adjust for these non-cash expenses and offer a more accurate view of the REIT’s ability to generate income and support dividends.


## What is FFO?

**Funds from Operations (FFO)** is a performance metric specifically designed to capture the true operating performance of a REIT by neutralizing the distortions created by non-cash accounting entries. It starts with **net income** and then **adds back depreciation and amortization**—expenses that reduce reported earnings but do not represent actual cash outflows for property maintenance or improvements. Furthermore, FFO excludes gains from property sales, which are considered non-recurring and not indicative of the REIT’s ongoing performance. This adjustment provides a clearer view of the **sustainable cash flow** generated from the REIT’s property portfolio, offering investors a consistent basis for comparing performance across periods and among different REITs.

Taking the concept a step further, FFO is standardized by industry bodies such as **NAREIT**, ensuring that its calculation is consistent across the sector. This standardization enhances its credibility as a benchmark for evaluating dividend sustainability, as it reflects the cash available for distribution after accounting for essential operational costs.


### FFO Formula

FFO = Net Income + Depreciation and Amortization − Gains on Sale of Properties

*Explanation:* **FFO** adjusts net income by removing non-cash depreciation charges and excluding one-time gains on property sales, emphasizing the recurring cash flow from rental operations.

The image below provides a real-world example of how FVR adjusts net income—by adding back non-cash charges like depreciation and excluding gains on property sales—to arrive at its Funds from Operations (FFO).

### Recognizing the Limitations of FFO

However, while FFO is a significant improvement over traditional earnings metrics, it does have limitations—it does not account for recurring **capital expenditures** required for property upkeep or enhancements, nor does it capture changes in working capital. Therefore, while FFO offers a more realistic depiction of operating performance by focusing on **cash generation**, investors often complement it with additional metrics like **Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)** to gain a comprehensive understanding of a REIT’s financial health.


## What is AFFO?

Building on the foundation of FFO, **Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)** offers a more granular view of a REIT’s cash-generating capability by further adjusting for recurring capital expenses. In calculating AFFO, the FFO figure is reduced by **recurring capital expenditures**—the necessary investments for maintaining, upgrading, and repositioning properties to stay competitive. Additionally, AFFO often accounts for other recurring costs such as **tenant improvements**, **leasing commissions**, and similar outlays that FFO does not capture, thereby stripping out additional non-operational items that could otherwise inflate the apparent cash flow.

This refinement results in a metric that more accurately represents the **sustainable cash flow** available to a REIT, directly aligning with its capacity to pay dividends and fund future growth. By addressing the real-world expenses essential for property upkeep and competitive positioning, AFFO serves as a superior indicator of a REIT’s **long-term financial health** and dividend reliability. This deeper insight into recurring cash flows provides investors with a clearer understanding of the true funds available for distribution and reinvestment, ensuring a more precise valuation of the REIT’s operational performance over time.


### AFFO Formula

AFFO = FFO − Recurring Capital Expenditures ± Other Non-Recurring Adjustments

*Explanation:* **AFFO** refines FFO further by subtracting regular property upkeep costs and making additional adjustments, offering a more precise measure of a REIT’s sustainable, distributable cash flow.

The image below demonstrates how FVR refines its FFO by subtracting recurring capital expenditures and other adjustments, resulting in Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)—a more precise measure of its sustainable cash flow.

## Enhancing the REIT analysis with FFO and AFFO

As a more suitable alternative, we use **FFO** and **AFFO** to calculate **FFO per share** and **AFFO per share**, which provide a clearer view of the cash-generating capacity of the REIT. In turn, **Price-to-FFO** and **Price-to-AFFO** ratios replace the traditional P/E ratio for valuation purposes, better capturing the recurring cash flow that underpins dividend payments and overall financial health. This shift acknowledges the unique nature of real estate assets, ensuring that investors have a more accurate basis for comparing REITs and assessing their long-term sustainability.

Below is a **step-by-step** illustration of how these figures translate into **per-share** values and **valuation multiples** for **Front View REIT (FVR)**, using the following data:



* **Shares Outstanding (FVR):** 14,977,310
* **Market Price per Share (on 25th Feb, 2025):** $17.46
* **Net Income (for EPS):** -$3,339,000
* **EPS:** -$0.22 (already calculated)
* **P/E Ratio:** -79.36 (already calculated, since EPS is negative)
* **FFO:** $3,780,000
* **AFFO:** $4,762,000


### 1. FFO per Share

FFO per Share = FFO / Shares Outstanding

          = $3,780,000 / 14,977,310

          ≈ $0.25

This figure indicates that FVR generates approximately $0.25 in **recurring operating cash flow** for each outstanding share. Unlike EPS—which is reduced by non-cash depreciation—FFO per share offers a **clearer snapshot** of how much actual cash the company’s property operations produce. A higher FFO per share typically signals stronger operational performance and a greater capacity to **support dividend payments**.


### 2. AFFO per Share

AFFO per Share = AFFO / Shares Outstanding 

            = $4,762,000 / 14,977,310

            ≈ $0.32

AFFO refines FFO by **subtracting recurring capital expenditures **and making other relevant adjustments (e.g., leasing costs, tenant improvements). The resulting $0.32 per share represents FVR’s sustainable cash flow, taking into account the real costs of maintaining and enhancing its properties. Because AFFO includes these necessary, ongoing expenses, it provides a **more precise measure** of the funds actually available for dividends and reinvestment.


### 3. Price-to-FFO

Price-to-FFO = Price per Share / FFO per Share

              = $17.46$0.25

              ≈ 69.8

This metric shows how much investors are paying for **each dollar of FFO**. A ratio of 69.8 means the market values FVR at about $69.80 for every $1.00 of FFO it generates. While high or low ratios can be relative to industry norms, a **higher multiple** often suggests that investors expect **robust growth** or **stable, long-term cash flows**. Conversely, a lower ratio could indicate market skepticism or higher perceived risk.


### 4. Price-to-AFFO

Price-to-AFFO = Price per Share / AFFO per Share

     = $17.46$0.32

     ≈ 54.6

Similar to Price-to-FFO, this ratio looks at how the market values the REIT based on its **AFFO**. At 54.6, investors are effectively paying $54.60 for each $1.00 of AFFO. Because **AFFO** accounts for necessary capital expenditures, many analysts view Price-to-AFFO as an even **better gauge** of a REIT’s valuation. A lower Price-to-AFFO might signal an undervalued REIT—or it could reflect concerns about future cash flow sustainability.


## EPS vs. FFO per Share vs. AFFO per Share

![Debt to Equity Ratio](/images/blogs/decoding-reit-performance-the-critical-roles-of-affo-and-ffo/eps-comparison-chart.png)

In this chart, **EPS** is shown at **-$0.22**, while **FFO per Share** is **$0.25**, and **AFFO per Share** is **$0.32**. At first glance, the negative EPS might suggest that FVR is operating at a substantial loss. However, this **loss** is largely the result of **non-cash depreciation charges** (and potentially other accounting items) that reduce **net income** but do **not** reduce **actual cash flow** from property operations. In real estate, properties often maintain or appreciate in value—especially with regular upkeep—so depreciation can mask genuine cash-generating power.

By contrast, **FFO** and **AFFO** strip out these non-cash expenses, making them **better indicators** of the true funds available for dividends and reinvestment. The difference between **FFO ($0.25)** and **AFFO ($0.32)** primarily reflects **recurring capital expenditures** and other adjustments. AFFO typically provides an even more accurate snapshot of **sustainable cash flow**, since it factors in the ongoing costs required to maintain or enhance the property portfolio. Consequently, while EPS may paint a gloomy picture, FFO and AFFO demonstrate that FVR is, in fact, generating positive cash flow from its operations.


## P/E Ratio vs. Price-to-FFO vs. Price-to-AFFO

![EPS Calculation](/images/blogs/decoding-reit-performance-the-critical-roles-of-affo-and-ffo/price-to-earning-ratio.png)

In the second chart, FVR’s **P/E ratio** stands at **-79.36**, again reflecting the negative EPS. A **negative P/E** is often deemed **not meaningful** for valuation purposes, because it suggests the company has no current earnings on which to base a multiple. For REITs, this scenario is **common** when accounting depreciation overwhelms net income, even though the REIT may still be profitable on a cash-flow basis.

To get around this limitation, investors look at **Price-to-FFO (69.8)** and **Price-to-AFFO (54.6)**. These metrics are analogous to a P/E ratio, but instead of using (possibly distorted) net income, they rely on **cash flow–oriented figures** that better reflect a REIT’s **operational strength**. While a higher Price-to-FFO or Price-to-AFFO can still indicate a premium valuation, they are far more **relevant** than a negative P/E ratio, as they speak to **recurring rental income** and the REIT’s **true ability to fund dividends**. Investors can compare these multiples to sector averages or peer REITs to judge whether FVR is trading at a **discount or premium** relative to its **underlying cash flows**.


## Why EPS and P/E Can Deceive Investors

Real estate depreciation frequently **overstates** the decline in property value, causing **net income—and thus EPS—to be artificially low**. When a REIT’s EPS is **negative or near zero**, its **P/E ratio** becomes either **negative or extremely high**, which offers little practical value for assessing its worth. Moreover, because REITs **distribute most of their earnings as dividends**, **cash flow** rather than net income is the primary driver of **dividend sustainability**. In contrast, **FFO** and **AFFO** are designed to capture a REIT’s **true economic earnings**, removing the distortions of non-cash depreciation and one-time gains. Consequently, **Price-to-FFO** and **Price-to-AFFO** ratios provide a **more accurate** gauge of whether a REIT is fairly valued, underpriced, or overpriced based on its **core operations**.


## Conclusion

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) operate under accounting rules that can significantly distort traditional metrics like **EPS** and the **P/E ratio**, primarily because **depreciation** and other non-cash charges lower reported net income without reducing actual cash flow. As demonstrated through FVR’s example, **FFO** and **AFFO** provide a more accurate view of a REIT’s ability to generate sustainable, distributable cash. By focusing on these **cash flow–based** measures, investors gain clearer insights into a REIT’s true operating performance and **dividend sustainability**, avoiding the pitfalls associated with negative or inflated earnings metrics. Additionally, **Price-to-FFO** and **Price-to-AFFO** ratios serve as REIT-specific valuation tools, offering a more meaningful alternative to the traditional P/E ratio. Ultimately, integrating **FFO** and **AFFO** into REIT analysis equips investors with a **deeper, more realistic** understanding of a REIT’s financial health and long-term growth prospects.
