A REIT’s cash flow statement is divided into three main sections: Cash Flows from Operating Activities, Cash Flows from Investing Activities, and Cash Flows from Financing Activities. By GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) convention in the United States, these sections help investors understand not only how a business is generating cash but also how it is deploying and distributing it. Because REITs are structured to pay out a high percentage of their earnings as dividends, the financing section of the cash flow statement (which captures payments to shareholders) is particularly active. Meanwhile, real estate acquisitions and dispositions typically drive the investing section, and ongoing property-level operations drive the operating section.

One important note about REITs is that they often heavily rely on depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash expenses, to reduce reported net income. For a typical REIT, especially one that owns a large portfolio of real estate, you often see substantial add-backs for these expenses in the operating section, revealing cash flows that can be notably larger than the net income figure. This dynamic underscores why the statement of cash flows is so critical: it provides a clearer picture of the REIT’s real liquidity and operational strength.

Below, we’ll outline each line item and expand on how each of the three example REITs handles it, along with two or more brief examples where relevant.

### Cashflow Statements

Here are the three REITs’ Income Statements as of September 30, 2024 that we will study:

## 1. Cash Flows From Operating Activities

### 1.1 Net Income (Loss)

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
Net income or net loss is the starting point for the indirect method of calculating operating cash flows (the most common method under GAAP). This figure is carried over from the income statement and then adjusted to remove non-cash items or items of a financing or investing nature.

In a REIT context, net income alone can be less indicative of actual cash generated by the core real estate operations because of depreciation, amortization, and other adjustments. As a result, net income for a REIT might look significantly lower (or higher) than total cash flows from operations would suggest.

**Modiv Example**
In Modiv’s consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was reported at approximately \$4.9 million, whereas the same period in 2023 showed a net loss of around \$6.9 million. Although Modiv recorded positive net income in 2024, that change alone does not capture the full operational performance due to the many adjustments we will discuss shortly.

**ELS Example**
ELS’s consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, show consolidated net income of approximately \$284.3 million, a significant figure that sets the stage for large adjustments in depreciation, amortization, and other items. ELS’s net income is typically more sizable because of its larger portfolio of manufactured housing and resort properties.

**PECO Example**
PECO reported net income of around \$49.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with \$48.6 million in the same period of 2023. Again, net income is simply the baseline from which many non-cash or reclassification adjustments follow.

### 1.2 Depreciation and Amortization

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
Depreciation (tied to buildings, improvements, and other tangible real property) and amortization (tied to intangible assets such as in-place leases or lease origination costs) reduce net income on the income statement but do not consume actual cash. Since REITs own real estate, these expenses are typically large, so they are added back to net income in the operating section to reflect that no cash was actually spent when these expenses were recorded.

**Modiv Example**
Modiv added back approximately \$12.4 million in depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This is in line with the fact that Modiv invests in industrial and other commercial properties that require significant capital expenditures and that carry large intangible lease assets and liabilities.

**ELS Example**
ELS added back \$157.5 million in depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Because ELS has a diversified property base—especially in manufactured home communities and RV resorts—its depreciation can be quite substantial. This line item is one of the largest adjustments to ELS’s net income.

**PECO Example**
PECO’s figure for depreciation and amortization of real estate assets was around \$188.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Given that PECO invests heavily in grocery-anchored shopping centers, it has significant building and tenant improvement assets, which drive this sizeable add-back.

### 1.3 Stock Compensation Expense / Share-Based Compensation

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
Many REITs reward their executives and key employees with stock-based awards. Under GAAP, the fair value of these awards is expensed on the income statement, even though issuing shares does not immediately require cash outlays in the period of the expense.

**Modiv Example**
Modiv recorded \$1.5 million of stock compensation expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This is a non-cash item that is added back to net income. In 2023, the figure was even higher (around \$9.8 million), showing how equity compensation can fluctuate year to year.

**ELS Example**
ELS’s compensation expense related to incentive plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was around \$7.2 million. Again, it is a non-cash item that inflates the net income figure downward, so the company adds it back in the reconciliation to operating cash flow.

**PECO Example**
PECO’s share-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was around \$7.0 million. Like the others, this expense is recognized on the income statement but has no immediate associated cash outflow, leading to an add-back on the statement of cash flows.

### 1.4 Amortization of (Below) Above Market Lease Intangibles, Net

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
When acquiring a property, a REIT may discover that some in-place leases are above or below the current market rental rate. In GAAP, these differences are recognized as intangible assets or liabilities. As those intangible amounts are amortized to income over the remaining lease term, the result is a reduction or increase in reported rental revenue—but it is purely an accounting adjustment with no direct ongoing cash impact. REITs thus add or subtract that amount in the operating section of the cash flow statement to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities.

**Modiv Example**
Modiv’s financial statements show an amortization of (below) above market lease intangibles, net, of about -\$634,798 (meaning a net credit, reducing net income, so it is effectively added back in the cash flow statement). This detail indicates that Modiv had intangible liabilities related to above-market leases, which lowered the recognized rental revenue.

**PECO Example**
PECO had net amortization of above- and below-market leases of about -\$4.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the net effect of intangible amortization for its various rental agreements in shopping center properties.

### 1.5 Straight-Line Rent Adjustments (Amortization of Deferred Rents)

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
Straight-line rent accounting requires REITs to average total rent revenue over the life of the lease, even if the tenant is scheduled to pay more rent in later years. This can result in earlier recognition of revenue, with no corresponding cash until later periods. Conversely, if the lease has rent abatements initially, the REIT might record a lower portion of the revenue up front. On the statement of cash flows, the resulting difference in recognized revenue versus actual cash inflows must be adjusted.

**Modiv Example**
Modiv shows a negative \$4.4 million for amortization of deferred rents, indicating that recognized rent revenue exceeded the actual cash received, thus requiring a downward adjustment to net income to reach net cash from operating activities.

**PECO Example**
PECO categorizes these adjustments under “Straight-line rent,” which was -\$6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Once again, this is reversed out to reconcile the difference between recognized revenue under straight-lining and actual rent collected.

### 1.6 Gains (Losses) on Sale or Disposal of Real Estate

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
When a REIT sells or disposes of a property, any gain or loss is typically recorded in the income statement. However, it is not an operating cash flow but rather an investing-related item. Therefore, REITs back out gains or losses to adjust net income in the operating section, and the proceeds are captured in the investing section.

**Modiv Example**
Modiv reported a gain on sale of real estate of about \$3.36 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This reduces net income when moving to operating cash flow because that gain was recorded on the income statement but did not produce operating cash in the period of recognition.

**ELS Example**
ELS had a “Loss on sale of real estate and impairment, net” figure of \$1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. While that negatively impacted net income, it is eliminated from operating cash flow calculations (except for any impairment that might be non-cash, which is similarly added back).

**PECO Example**
PECO’s “Loss (gain) on disposal of property, net” was \$34,000 for 2024 (a small net loss). This is reversed in the operating cash flow, since the actual proceeds from property sales show up under investing activities.

### 1.7 Unrealized Gains or Losses (e.g., on Interest Rate Swaps or Marketable Securities)

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
Some REITs hold derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps. Changes in fair value of these swaps can produce unrealized gains or losses. These are recognized on the income statement under GAAP but represent no immediate cash inflow or outflow, so they are reversed in the operating section.

**Modiv Example**
Modiv recognized a \$1.7 million unrealized loss on interest rate swap valuation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Because this is non-cash, it increases operating cash flow in the indirect reconciliation.

### 1.8 Non-Cash Impairments (Real Estate or Investment Assets)

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
If a REIT determines that the carrying value of a property is not recoverable, it records an impairment charge. This reduces net income but has no immediate effect on cash flows, so it is added back in the operating section.

**Modiv Example**
In 2023, Modiv recorded a \$3.5 million impairment of real estate investment property, which was added back to net income for operating cash flow purposes.

**PECO Example**
PECO recorded a \$3.0 million impairment on investment in third parties in 2023. It was a non-cash charge and thus reversed out when computing net cash from operating activities.

### 1.9 Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities (Working Capital Items)

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
Working capital changes—items like tenant receivables, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities—can produce short-term swings in the cash flow. For REITs, this may include significant seasonal or cyclical fluctuations (such as property tax payments, tenant reimbursements, or large maintenance projects).

**Examples**

- **Increase (decrease) in tenant deferred rent and other receivables**
- **Increase (decrease) in prepaid expenses and other assets**
- **Increase (decrease) in accounts payable, accrued, and other liabilities**

For all three of our example companies, these adjustments appear toward the bottom of the operating activities reconciliation, reflecting normal fluctuations in their real estate operations.

## 2. Cash Flows From Investing Activities

### 2.1 Real Estate Acquisitions

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
Because real estate is the core asset class for REITs, purchases of new properties or expansions of existing holdings are the major use of cash under investing activities. REITs typically invest large amounts of capital to grow their portfolio.

**Modiv Example**
Modiv shows acquisitions of real estate investments of about -\$5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This is notably smaller than the -\$122.8 million for the same period in 2023, signaling that Modiv reduced its acquisition pace.

**ELS Example**
ELS recorded about -\$24,000 in real estate acquisitions, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024—much lower than some prior-year figures. ELS’s capital typically goes into improvements rather than new acquisitions in some periods.

**PECO Example**
PECO had significant outlays for real estate acquisitions, roughly -\$205.0 million, reflecting the purchase of new grocery-anchored shopping centers in 2024.

### 2.2 Capital Expenditures / Additions to Existing Properties

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
Capital expenditures can include improvements, expansions, and maintenance to existing properties that extend their useful life or enhance their income potential. Because these outlays are not expensed immediately on the income statement (they are capitalized and depreciated over time), they appear in the cash flow statement under investing activities.

**Modiv Example**
Modiv reported around -\$1.8 million in additions to existing real estate investments for 2024, reflecting improvements or expansions in its portfolio.

**ELS Example**
ELS reported -\$175.6 million in “Capital improvements” for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This substantial figure demonstrates ELS’s strategic efforts to upgrade and maintain the attractiveness of its communities and resorts, thus likely supporting rent growth and occupancy over the long term.

**PECO Example**
PECO’s capital expenditures were about -\$55.6 million in 2024. This included improvements to anchor tenants, property redevelopments, façade renovations, parking lot repavings, and other enhancements critical to retail property maintenance.

### 2.3 Proceeds from Sale of Real Estate Investments

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
When REITs dispose of properties, the cash proceeds are recorded here. The gain or loss from the sale, as noted earlier, appears on the income statement but is stripped out of operating cash flow, while the actual proceeds get recognized under investing activities.

**Modiv Example**
Modiv reported net proceeds of \$15.0 million from the sale of real estate investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the successful disposition of certain assets, presumably to optimize its portfolio.

**PECO Example**
PECO’s proceeds from sale of real estate, net, were minimal in 2024 (around -\$26, reflecting some final transaction or closing adjustment). In 2023, it had a net positive inflow of \$7.1 million from sales.

### 2.4 Investments in or Distributions from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
Many REITs form joint ventures to partially own properties. The cash flow statement reflects outgoing contributions to these ventures and incoming distributions of income or return of capital from them.

**ELS Example**
ELS recorded investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of -\$9.3 million and distributions of capital from unconsolidated ventures of \$14.1 million for 2024.

**PECO Example**
PECO contributed around -\$3.6 million to unconsolidated joint ventures while receiving \$1.5 million as a return of investment during 2024.

## 3. Cash Flows From Financing Activities

### 3.1 Borrowings from Credit Facilities, Term Loans, and Mortgage Notes

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
When REITs need capital, they often tap credit facilities or issue mortgage notes on their properties. Any borrowing appears as a cash inflow, while any repayment appears as a cash outflow.

**Modiv Example**
In 2023, Modiv secured \$100 million from a term loan on its credit facility, a major inflow in that period. In 2024, the statements show more modest or no term loan borrowings. Mortgage note principal payments of -\$188,932 also appear for 2024, reflecting ongoing amortization or paydown.

**ELS Example**
ELS had line-of-credit proceeds of \$383.5 million and line-of-credit repayments of -\$382 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, illustrating how REITs draw on revolving credit lines in a fluid manner.

**PECO Example**
PECO obtained \$372 million from its revolving credit facility in 2024 but also paid down -\$517 million. This net outflow can indicate either the application of free cash to reduce debt or that some acquisitions were financed in other ways (e.g., new mortgage notes). PECO also shows proceeds from notes and loans payable of \$683.1 million, offset by payments on mortgages and loans of -\$407.7 million.

### 3.2 Issuance (or Repurchase) of Common Stock and Preferred Stock

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
Since REITs are often externally funded entities, they may issue new equity to finance property acquisitions, pay down debt, or for general corporate purposes. Conversely, some REITs engage in share repurchases. The net effect of share issuances or repurchases is captured in the financing section.

**Modiv Example**
Modiv’s statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, show proceeds of \$3.3 million from offering of common stock and -\$11.5 million for repurchases of common stock and Class C OP Units. Repurchases reduce the total number of shares/units outstanding and can be used to shore up the share price or adjust the capital structure.

**PECO Example**
PECO had no large public offering proceeds in 2024 but in 2023 raised approximately \$70.9 million from new equity. That funding contributed to acquisitions and other capital uses.

### 3.3 Dividends and Distributions Paid

**Definition and REIT-Specific Consideration**
A defining feature of REITs is their requirement to distribute a substantial portion of taxable income to shareholders. This means the financing section of their cash flow statements typically includes large outflows for dividends on common and preferred shares, as well as distributions to holders of operating partnership units if applicable.

**Modiv Example**
Modiv paid -\$2.8 million in dividends to preferred stockholders and -\$7.8 million to common stockholders and Class C OP Unit holders in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These outflows reduce cash but are consistent with REIT statutory obligations to distribute income.

**ELS Example**
For 2024, ELS recorded -\$261.5 million in distributions to common stockholders and -\$12.8 million to common OP unitholders, along with a smaller amount to preferred stockholders. As ELS is a large REIT, dividend payouts form a significant part of its financing cash flows.

**PECO Example**
PECO paid -\$108.6 million in distributions to its common stockholders and, to a lesser extent, to noncontrolling interests (-\$12.4 million), emphasizing the company’s robust distribution policy.

## 4. Supplemental Disclosures and Non-Cash Activities

REITs often provide separate schedules showing non-cash transactions, such as the issuance of operating partnership units in exchange for property acquisitions or the conversion of certain stock classes. These do not produce or use cash, so they are not recorded as inflows or outflows in the main body of the statement.

- **Modiv** disclosed, for example, a distribution of GIPR common stock, conversion of certain OP Units, and other equity-based transactions.
- **PECO** disclosed right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities, accrued capital expenditures, and similar items.

These supplemental items help investors reconcile changes in the balance sheet with the actual cash inflows and outflows that appear in the core cash flow statement.

## Comparing the Three REITs’ Cash Flow Statements and Identifying the Stronger Profile

After dissecting the various line items, let us reflect on how each REIT’s statement appears qualitatively. All three are real estate investment trusts, but they have different property focuses and different scales:

1. **Modiv**

- Modiv’s net income swung from a loss in 2023 to a modest positive in 2024. Its operating cash flow for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was about \$12.8 million, supported by the usual add-backs such as depreciation and amortization.
- The changes in the investing section highlight more modest real estate purchases in 2024, plus some property sales that brought in proceeds, improving Modiv’s net investing cash flows.
- On the financing side, Modiv had net outflows (around -\$19.0 million) tied to share repurchases, dividends, and limited new equity issuance.

2. **Equity LifeStyle Properties (ELS)**

- ELS is generally the larger, more established entity among the three. Net income in 2024 (for the nine-month period) is \$284.3 million, and cash flow from operations is \$491.4 million. The scale of its depreciation and capital improvements is far larger, reflecting a long-standing portfolio of manufactured home communities and RV resorts.
- ELS invests substantially in upgrading and maintaining properties, which is evident in the large negative capital improvement line item (-\$175.6 million).
- On the financing side, ELS’s net outflows revolve around the payment of hefty dividends (-\$261.5 million to common stockholders), plus the typical draws and repayments on credit lines.

3. **Phillips Edison & Company (PECO)**

- PECO reported net income of \$49.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with an operating cash flow of \$250.7 million. This suggests a healthy spread between net income and operating cash flow, thanks to large non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization.
- In the investing section, PECO spent heavily (-\$205.0 million) on acquiring grocery-anchored shopping centers and devoted further sums to capital expenditures. The net effect is a sizable negative figure in its investing activity total.
- On the financing side, PECO had a small net positive inflow (\$9.4 million), balancing large distributions (-\$108.6 million) with new debt issuances (\$683.1 million) and repayment of old debt.

When evaluating which “income statement” or cash flow profile looks “better,” we focus on qualitative measures like the stability and sustainability of operations, the alignment of acquisition/disposition strategies, and the capacity to fund distributions without overreliance on external financing.

- **ELS** demonstrates a high level of stable operating cash flows, likely due to longstanding, reliable communities. Its large negative investing cash flow is indicative of a strategic choice to reinvest in existing communities, which can be a healthy long-term approach. ELS also pays substantial dividends, yet it appears to manage these consistently.

- **PECO** is also showing healthy operational cash flows and invests aggressively to expand its property footprint. Its acquisitions are large, in line with a growth strategy focusing on grocery-anchored centers. Despite high distributions, PECO manages to keep a balanced financing approach by raising debt (and in past periods, equity).

- **Modiv** is smaller but has made progress, moving from negative net income to positive net income. It is more selective in acquisitions, reflecting a strategic pivot or a more measured approach to portfolio management. The net proceeds from real estate sales and modest acquisitions indicate that Modiv is refining its portfolio.

In terms of “quality,” rather than size, ELS and PECO both show a strong operating base and consistent cash flows, with ELS having a longer track record of robust net income. Modiv, while improved, is still in growth and portfolio optimization mode. Arguably, **ELS** has the more stable and time-tested performance, as evidenced by its large, recurring operating cash flow and the consistent manner in which it invests capital. **PECO** similarly exhibits strong, recurring cash flows—particularly relevant as the grocery-anchored retail segment has shown resilience in recent market cycles. **Modiv** may be forging its own path, but from a pure “cash flow stability” viewpoint, ELS and PECO might appear “better” for reliability, with ELS especially consistent over many years.

That said, each REIT’s strategy, property sector, and stage of growth differ, and those differences will appeal to different investors. Income-oriented investors might appreciate ELS’s relatively predictable distributions, while those seeking a growth story might find PECO’s acquisition strategy or Modiv’s pivot more interesting.

## Conclusion

A REIT’s statement of cash flows is crucial for understanding the true nature of its operational performance, the reinvestment or disposition of its properties, and the extent to which dividends and other obligations are being financed by ongoing operations rather than external borrowings or equity issuance. In reviewing the statements from Modiv, ELS, and PECO, we observe shared line items—net income, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation, intangible lease adjustments, capital expenditures, and distributions—each illustrating standard REIT accounting practices but tailored to each entity’s portfolio strategy and balance sheet management.

The comparison reveals that ELS has the largest and possibly the most stable overall cash flow base, reflecting its well-established property portfolio. PECO, focusing on grocery-anchored retail centers, also showcases robust and growing operating cash flows with strategic acquisitions. Modiv, though smaller, highlights an improved financial performance from 2023 to 2024 and a balanced approach to portfolio transactions.

Ultimately, “better” or “stronger” from an investor’s perspective will depend on one’s appetite for stability versus growth, as well as sector preferences (industrial, manufactured housing, or grocery-anchored shopping centers). Nevertheless, all three REITs demonstrate the standard structure and logic of REIT cash flow statements under GAAP, with sizable non-cash adjustments in the operating section, significant property acquisition and disposition activities in the investing section, and large dividend payments, credit facility borrowings, and debt repayments in the financing section. These elements underscore why examining a REIT’s cash flow statement is indispensable for discerning how effectively it generates, allocates, and distributes capital over time.
