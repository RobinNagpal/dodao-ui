# Understanding REITs and Key Metrics for Evaluation

## What are REITs

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) provide investors with a way to access real estate markets without directly purchasing or managing properties. These companies own, operate, or finance income-generating real estate assets, offering investors returns primarily through dividend payments derived from rental income or interest on real estate loans.

### Types of REITs

REITs are categorized into different types based on their investment focus. **Equity REITs** primarily own and manage income-producing properties, generating revenue through rent collection. **Mortgage REITs** focus on real estate financing by investing in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, earning income from interest payments. **Hybrid REITs** incorporate elements of both, investing in physical properties as well as real estate debt to create a diversified income stream. 

When analyzing REITs, factors on which to evaluate them vary from type to type. For example:

* **Equity REITs**: Key factors include Debt and leverage, Rental Health, Cost of Operations, FFO, AFFO and Stock Types
* **Mortgage REITs (mREITs)**: Evaluation focuses on interest rate sensitivity, net interest margin (NIM), leverage levels, and prepayment risks.
* **Hybrid REITs**: A combination of **Equity and Mortgage REIT** metrics, evaluating **both property value appreciation and interest rate sensitivity**.

Many analysts have been evaluating REITs by analyzing financial statements but often overlook key metrics like Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO), Funds from Operations (FFO), and leverage, leaving investors confused.

In this article, we will focus on the essential factors for evaluating **Equity REITs**, as they make up the largest portion of the market compared to Mortgage or Hybrid REITs. Rather than just examining financial statements, we’ll dive deeper into critical performance indicators, making the evaluation process clearer and more straightforward for investors.

## Debt and Leverage in REITs

### Understanding Debt in REITs

Debt is money that a REIT borrows to buy properties, develop real estate, or cover daily expenses. It has two key features:

* **Principal** – The amount borrowed that must be repaid.
* **Interest Rate** – The cost of borrowing, which affects how much a REIT pays back over time.

**Types of REIT Debt: Risks and Benefits**

REITs have different types of debt, and each debt type comes with its own risks and benefits.

* **Long-term debt**: These loans, such as **mortgages, term loans, and secured debt**, are repaid over many years. 
    * **Benefit:** They provide stable financing with predictable repayment schedules.
    * **Risk:** If interest rates drop, REITs may be locked into higher fixed rates, making refinancing expensive.
* **Short-term debt**: REITs use **credit lines and bridge loans** for quick cash. 
    * **Benefit:** They offer flexibility and fast access to funds. 
    * **Risk:** They usually have **higher interest rates and shorter repayment deadlines**, which can create cash flow problems if refinancing options become limited.
* **Mezzanine financing & subordinated debt**: These are **higher-risk loans** that charge more interest but help REITs access additional funding. 
    * **Benefit:** They can bridge financing gaps when traditional loans are not enough.
    * **Risk:** They come with **higher costs and are often unsecured**, meaning lenders can demand repayment sooner if the REIT faces financial trouble.
* **Convertible debt**: Loans that can be converted into **company shares instead of cash repayment**. 
    * **Benefit:** They offer lower initial interest costs and allow REITs to preserve cash.
    * **Risk:** If stock prices rise, investors may convert their debt into shares, which dilutes ownership for existing shareholders.

Understanding these debt types helps investors assess how a REIT manages its financial stability and growth potential.

### Why REIT Debt Matters

Looking at a REIT’s debt is important because:

* **High-interest debt reduces profits**: If a REIT has loans with high interest rates, a large part of its earnings will go toward paying interest instead of dividends.
* **Too much short-term debt can create cash problems**: If a REIT relies too much on short-term loans, it may struggle to refinance them when they are due.
* **A balanced debt strategy helps with stable growth**: REITs that use long-term debt wisely can expand without running into sudden financial trouble.
* **Interest rate changes affect costs**: If a REIT has loans with variable interest rates, its borrowing costs will rise when interest rates increase, which can lower earnings.

### What is Leverage?

Leverage means **using borrowed money to buy more properties and grow faster**. Instead of only using its own money, a REIT borrows funds to acquire larger assets.

* **Good leverage** helps a REIT buy more properties and make bigger profits when rental income or property values go up.
* **Bad leverage** makes things worse in tough times—if rents go down or property prices drop, the REIT still has to repay its loans, which can lead to financial trouble.

#### **How Is Leverage Different from Debt?**

* **Debt** is the actual money a REIT borrows.
* **Leverage** is how much a REIT depends on borrowed money compared to its own money (equity).

For example, if a REIT owns properties worth **$1 billion** but has borrowed **$600 million**, its leverage is **60%**.

### Why REIT Leverage Matters

* **High leverage means higher financial risk**: A REIT with too much debt may struggle to pay back loans if property income falls.
* **Leverage affects dividends**: If a REIT spends too much on loan payments, it may have less money left for investor payouts.
* **Leverage impacts future investments**: A REIT with too much debt might not get more loans, making it harder to buy new properties.
* **Market downturns hit leveraged REITs harder**: When property prices fall, REITs with high leverage may owe more than their properties are worth.

## Rental Health: Rent vs. Market Rents & Occupancy Rates

### What is Rental Health?

Rental health refers to the **stability and sustainability** of a REIT’s rental income. It is determined by factors like **occupancy rates, rental prices compared to market rates, and tenant retention**. A REIT with strong rental health generates **steady cash flow**, which is critical for paying dividends and maintaining property values.

### Why Rental Health is Important for REITs

* **A strong rental income stream ensures steady dividends**: REITs rely on rental income to distribute earnings to investors. A weak rental performance can reduce dividend payouts.
* **Vacant properties lead to lost revenue**: Empty units mean no rent collection, impacting overall income and profitability.
* **Market rents determine pricing power**: If a REIT charges below-market rents, it may struggle to grow revenue. Charging above-market rents could lead to high tenant turnover.
* **Tenant stability impacts long-term performance**: Frequent tenant turnover increases costs related to leasing, marketing, and property maintenance.

### What are Occupancy Rates?

Occupancy rate is the **percentage of rented space** in a REIT’s portfolio compared to the total available space. It directly reflects the demand for the REIT’s properties.

### Why Occupancy Rates Matter for REITs

* **Higher occupancy rates mean stable income**: A REIT with **90%+ occupancy** is more financially secure than one struggling to fill vacancies.
* **Low occupancy can signal weak demand**: If a REIT has many vacant units, it may be due to **poor property management, high rents, or a weak location**.
* **Market comparison helps assess performance**: A REIT with occupancy rates **above the industry average** is performing well, while below-average rates may indicate problems.

### How to Evaluate a REIT’s Occupancy Rate

* **Compare historical data**:  Has the REIT maintained or improved occupancy over time? A declining rate may indicate poor tenant retention or economic challenges.
* **Analyze market benchmarks**: If competitors in the same region have **higher occupancy rates**, the REIT may be overpricing rents or struggling with property appeal.
* **Assess individual property occupancy**: Some properties may have higher vacancies, pulling down overall performance. Investors should check if certain assets are underperforming.

## Cost of Operations in REITs

### What are the Costs of Operations in a REIT?

The cost of operations in a REIT refers to the **expenses involved in managing and maintaining properties**, ensuring tenant satisfaction, and running the REIT’s business. These costs vary by REIT type, but **Equity REITs** generally have **higher operating expenses** since they own and manage physical properties.

Key cost components include:

* **Property management costs**: Expenses related to leasing, maintenance, and tenant services.
* **Repairs & maintenance**: Regular upkeep and unexpected repairs to keep properties in good condition.
* **Property taxes & insurance**: Mandatory costs that vary by location and property type.
* **Utilities & operational expenses**: Electricity, water, security, and other ongoing property costs.
* **General & administrative (G&A) costs**:   Staff salaries, marketing, legal fees, and REIT management costs.

### Why Investors Should Analyze REIT Operating Costs

* **Higher costs reduce profitability**: If a REIT spends too much on operations, it may have **lower net income**, reducing dividends for investors.
* **Cost efficiency impacts dividend stability**: A well-managed REIT with controlled expenses can maintain consistent **FFO (Funds from Operations)** and **AFFO (Adjusted Funds from Operations)**, which are crucial for dividend payouts.
* **Comparing costs helps assess management quality**:  A REIT with **higher expenses than its peers** may have poor cost control, inefficient operations, or expensive property maintenance issues.
* **Impact on rental income growth**: If operational costs rise **faster than rental income**, the REIT may struggle to grow profits.

In our **detailed blog on REIT cost structures**, we explain **the different types of operating expenses and why they matter for investors**. **To learn more, read our full blog here: **[https://koalagains.com/blogs/breaking-down-reit-expense-analyzing-costs-with-front-view-reit](https://koalagains.com/blogs/breaking-down-reit-expense-analyzing-costs-with-front-view-reit) 

## FFO and AFFO: Key Metrics for Evaluating REITs

### What is FFO (Funds from Operations)?

Funds from Operations (FFO) is a key financial metric that measures a REIT’s **true operating performance** by removing the impact of non-cash accounting items. Since REITs own physical properties, their financial statements include **depreciation and amortization**, which lower reported net income but do not reflect actual cash expenses.

To provide a clearer view of a REIT’s real earnings, FFO starts with **net income** and adds back these non-cash expenses. It also excludes **gains from property sales**, as these are **one-time transactions** and do not reflect the REIT’s ongoing rental income.

### Why FFO is Important for REIT Investors

* **Removes misleading accounting expenses**: Since depreciation is a **non-cash charge**, it does not impact actual cash flow, making FFO a more accurate measure of profitability.
* **Focuses on core rental income**: By excluding property sale profits, FFO highlights **recurring income from rental properties**, which is key for long-term investors.
* **Industry standard metric**: FFO is widely used and standardized by **NAREIT (National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts)**, allowing for **easy comparison** between different REITs.
* **Better indicator of dividend potential:** Since REITs are required to distribute most of their income as dividends, FFO provides a clearer picture of the cash available for payouts.

#### **FFO Formula**

FFO = Net Income + Depreciation and Amortization − Gains on Sale of Properties

**Explanation:** This formula adjusts **net income** by adding back non-cash depreciation costs and removing one-time property sale gains, providing a **clearer view of rental income sustainability**.

### What is AFFO (Adjusted Funds from Operations)?

Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) **goes a step further than FFO** by accounting for **recurring capital expenditures** and other operational adjustments that directly impact cash flow. These include **property maintenance costs, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions**, which are necessary to keep properties competitive and generate long-term rental income.

Since these recurring expenses are essential for sustaining a REIT’s operations, **AFFO provides a more accurate measure of the cash available for dividends and reinvestment.**

### Why AFFO is Important for REIT Investors

* **More precise measure of cash flow**: While FFO gives a broad view of cash flow, AFFO **removes essential expenses** like repairs and leasing costs, making it a **better predictor of dividend sustainability**.
* **Indicates long-term financial health**: High AFFO suggests the REIT **earns enough to cover dividends and property maintenance**, reducing the risk of future dividend cuts.
* **Helps assess management efficiency**: If a REIT has consistently declining AFFO, it may be overspending on maintenance or struggling with high tenant turnover.
* **Preferred for dividend analysis**: Since REITs must **return most of their income to investors**, AFFO is the best metric for evaluating **how much cash is truly available for distributions**.

#### **AFFO Formula**

AFFO = FFO - Recurring Capital Expenditures ± Other Non - Recurring Adjustments

**Explanation:** AFFO refines **FFO** by deducting necessary capital expenses like property maintenance and leasing costs. This **gives a clearer picture of how much cash the REIT has left for dividends and growth**.

We’ve taken a **deep dive into Front View REIT’s cash flow **and** adjustments for recurring expenses.** **For a complete breakdown, read our detailed blog here: **[https://koalagains.com/blogs/decoding-reit-performance-the-critical-roles-of-affo-and-ffo](https://koalagains.com/blogs/decoding-reit-performance-the-critical-roles-of-affo-and-ffo) 

## Stock Types in REITs: Why They Matter

REITs issue different types of stocks and debt instruments, each with **unique risks, returns, and implications for investors**. Understanding these types helps investors assess a REIT’s **capital structure, dividend obligations, and dilution risks**.

### 1. Common Equity Shares

#### **What Are They?**

Common shares represent **ownership in the REIT**, giving shareholders voting rights and entitlement to dividends.

#### **Why They Matter for Investors**

* **Dividend income**: REITs must distribute most of their income as dividends, making common shares attractive for income-focused investors.
* **Potential price appreciation**: Share prices may rise if the REIT grows or improves performance.
* **Voting rights**: Shareholders have a say in company decisions, including board elections and major transactions.

#### **Risks**

* **Dividend cuts**: If a REIT faces financial trouble, common shareholders are the first to see dividend reductions.
* **Market volatility**: Common shares fluctuate with REIT performance, interest rates, and market trends.

### 2. Preferred Shares

#### **What Are They?**

Preferred shares are **a hybrid between stocks and bonds**, offering **fixed dividends** but usually without voting rights.

#### **Why They Matter for Investors**

* **Higher dividend priority**:  Preferred shareholders get dividends **before** common shareholders, making them more secure.
* **Fixed dividend income**: Unlike common shares, preferred dividends **do not fluctuate** with earnings.
* **Lower volatility**: Preferred shares are **less sensitive to stock market swings** than common shares.

#### **Risks**

* **Limited upside**: Preferred shareholders **do not benefit from rising REIT stock prices**.
* **Interest rate risk**: Since preferred dividends are fixed, their value **drops when interest rates rise**, making them less attractive compared to bonds.
* **Dividend suspension risk**: In a downturn, REITs may suspend **preferred dividends**, though they must be paid before common shareholders receive anything.

### 3. Convertible Preferred Shares

#### **What Are They?**

These are **preferred shares that can be converted into common shares** at a predetermined ratio.

#### **Why They Matter for Investors**

* **Higher dividend priority than common shares**: Investors receive steady income before common shareholders.
* **Potential upside**: If the REIT performs well, investors can **convert to common shares** and benefit from stock price growth.
* **Lower volatility**: Like preferred shares, these are **more stable** than common shares.

#### **Risks for Common Shareholders (CSH)**

* **Dilution risk**: If many preferred shares convert to common stock, existing shareholders’ **ownership percentage decreases**.
* **Dividend burden**:  REITs must **pay preferred dividends before common dividends**, reducing cash available for common shareholders.

## Conclusion

By evaluating **debt, rental health, operating costs, FFO/AFFO, and stock structure**, investors can gain **a comprehensive understanding of a REIT’s financial health and long-term growth potential**. Investors should **look beyond financial statements** and analyze **key performance indicators** to make well-informed decisions.
