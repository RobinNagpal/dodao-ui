Cayman offers you five main fund **labels** under two different laws—**Private Fund, Registered Fund, Administered Fund, Licensed Fund, and the Limited-Investor Fund exemption**—and you can also add an optional **Segregated Portfolio Company (SPC)** layer on top. All these fund types can be set up quickly, often in a matter of days. However, each label changes how much you pay in CIMA fees, who can invest, what audits you must do, and which service providers you need. Below you will find:

1. The exact legal rules and application forms you need.
2. The government fees that took effect on **1 January 2025**.
3. A realistic first-year budget for professional fees.
4. Where these funds usually bank (in Cayman, U.S. fintech channels, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein).
5. A 20-point table that compares all fund types side by side.


## 1 Regulatory backdrop

Cayman funds split into two main groups:

* **Open-ended funds** (where investors can put in or take out money any time) fall under the **Mutual Funds Act (Revised 2025)**.
* **Closed-ended funds** (where investors commit money and can only redeem at set times) follow the **Private Funds Act (2024 Revision)**.

Both laws give the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) the power to license and supervise these funds. They do this through an online system called the **REEFS e-portal**, where you submit all your fund forms and updates. REEFS stands for “Regulated Entities Electronic Filing System,” and it keeps track of your application, fee payments, and annual reports. You can find all fund forms here: [CIMA Forms](https://www.cima.ky/investment-funds-forms?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and details on fees here: [CIMA Fees](https://www.cima.ky/updated-cima-and-registry-fees-now-in-effect?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## 2 Core structures in detail
Below is a closer look at each fund type, who it is best for, what you must file, the fees involved, an estimated professional budget, and any special requirements you need to keep in mind.

### 2.1 Private Fund (closed‑ended)

* **Who it suits** - This fund is best if you run a **venture capital** (VC), **credit**, or **token-based** strategy that does **not** let investors take out money at will. Investors commit capital up front and can only get it back at specific exit events or liquidity windows.

* **Key filings** - You must file the **PF Application** package in REEFS. This includes the formal fund application plus the **Fund Annual Return (FAR) enrolment**. The FAR is how you report fund data to CIMA every year. For more on the PF package, see Conyers’ guide: [Registering Private Funds](https://www.conyers.com/publications/view/registering-private-funds-with-cima-2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

* **Government fees** - You pay **US \$365** when you apply, and **US \$4 270** each year after that (rates as of 2025). These are fixed CIMA fees you must include in your budget.&#x20;

* **Professional budget** - Plan for about **US \$25 – 50 k** in legal and setup costs. This covers a simple **Exempted Limited Partnership (ELP)** agreement, an **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** manual, and the fees for Cayman-based or registered **directors**.

* **Complexities**
  * You must file **audited financial statements** and your FAR within **six months** of your financial year end.
  * The fund needs **at least two directors** who can live anywhere.
  * You have **21 days** from the first investor commitment to submit your PF application.&#x20;

* **Blockchain example** - **Pantera Blockchain Offshore Fund LP** is a real-world example. It is set up as an ELP under the Private Funds Act, with its certificate dated in **2024**.

### 2.2 Registered Mutual Fund (s 4(3))

* **Who it suits**
Ideal for **liquid** hedge or index funds that let investors redeem on a **weekly** or **monthly** basis. Good if you aim to manage topical strategies like crypto indices or currency overlays.

* **Eligibility** - You need either:
  1. A **US \$100 k minimum** initial subscription from each investor,
  2. Or a listing on a stock exchange that CIMA has approved.
  See the listing details here: [CIMA Investment Funds](https://www.cima.ky/investment-funds?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Forms** - You submit the **MF1** form and upload your **Offering Memorandum (OM)** to the portal. The OM explains investment terms, fees, and risks. Download the MF1 here: [MF1 Form](https://www.cima.ky/upimages/formsdata/MutualFundsLawMF1Form_1621529446.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Fees** - **US \$366** to apply, plus **US \$4 268** each year in renewal fees.&#x20;
* **Professional budget** - Expect **US \$30 – 60 k**. This covers drafting fund documents, hiring a Cayman fund **administrator**, and paying a listing agent if you need one.
* **Complexities**
  * You must do an **annual audit** of the fund’s accounts.
  * File a **Fund Annual Return** each year.
  * **Register each director** under the Directors Registration & Licensing Act (the DRL Act).&#x20;
* **Example** - The **Bitwise 10 Index Offshore Fund** is a registered fund that feeds into a crypto index strategy.


### 2.3 Administered Mutual Fund (s 4(1)(b))

* **Who it suits** - Funds that want a **Cayman-licensed administrator** but prefer a lighter touch from CIMA. Perfect if you don’t need the full disclosures of a Registered Fund.
* **Forms** - Use **MF2** (or **MF2A** for amendments). Instead of meeting the US \$100 k test, your Cayman administrator signs an **affidavit** confirming they will provide services. All forms are here: [CIMA Administered Forms](https://www.cima.ky/investment-funds-forms?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Fees** - Same as a Registered Fund: **US \$366** to apply and **US \$4 268** each year.
* **Extra duty** - Your administrator must file a **monthly Net Asset Value (NAV)** report with CIMA. This report summarises your fund’s assets and liabilities.

### 2.4 Licensed Mutual Fund (s 4(1)(a))

* **Who it suits** - This is a **retail-friendly** full licence with **no minimum subscription**. It lets you market widely to retail and professional investors.
* **Forms** - Complete **MF3**, which includes a detailed **business plan** and **fit-and-proper questionnaires** for directors and key officers. Find the forms here: [MF3 Form](https://www.cima.ky/investment-funds-forms?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Fees** - **US \$4 482** to apply and **US \$4 482** annually (2025 rates).
* **Professional budget** - About **US \$60 – 120 k**. This covers drafting a full **prospectus**, hiring a Cayman **custodian**, and setting up compliance systems.
* **Complexities**
  * You need a **Cayman-licensed custodian** to hold your assets.
  * Appoint **three independent directors**.
  * Submit all marketing materials to CIMA for **pre-clearance** before you launch.&#x20;

### 2.5 Limited‑Investor Fund exemption (≤15 holders)

* **Statutory basis** - Under Mutual Funds Act **s 4(4)**, if you have **15 or fewer** investors, you can use a lighter regime.
* **Forms** - File **App-101-78**, a simpler form that does **not** need an Offering Memorandum. See the form here: [Limited-Investor Form](https://www.cima.ky/investment-funds-forms?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* **Fees** - Only **US \$4 268** each year (same as Registered).
* **Use-case** - Great for **family offices** or to test a new **crypto strategy** before you scale up.

### 2.6 Segregated Portfolio Company (SPC) overlay
You can convert any company-based fund into an **SPC** or add ring-fenced “cells,” each like a mini-fund with its own assets and liabilities.

* **Fee** - One-time **US \$610** plus **US \$1 463** annual base fee, and **US \$305** per cell you create.&#x20;
* **Complexity** - Each cell needs its own **audit** and **NAV reporting**, and there are special rules if one cell becomes insolvent so it does not affect the others.

## 3 Exact government forms & what they do
Here is a quick table of each main form you will use, what law it follows, and why you file it.

| Form                       | Statute trigger         | Purpose                                |                  |

## 4 Cost stack (government **and** typical professional)
Below is a breakdown of the main cost items you must budget for each fund type.

## 7 Practical take‑aways
1. **Match the redemption profile to the law.** - If you need daily or weekly liquidity, you must use the Mutual Funds Act (Registered, Administered, Licensed, or Limited-Investor). Closed-ended token VC or private equity funds belong under the Private Funds Act.
2. **Budget beyond CIMA fees.** - The small US \$365 filing fee is only a tiny part of your launch cost. The bigger items are legal drafting, audits, director fees, AML manuals, and custodian or administrator costs—easily **US \$10 k+ per year**.
3. **Pre-clear your banking early.** - Cayman banks often ask crypto-heavy funds for six-figure balances. A common setup is a local **Butterfield** operating account plus a **U.S. CBIT** account for 24/7 USD settlement.
