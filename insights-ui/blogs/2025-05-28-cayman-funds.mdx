Cayman gives you five core fund “labels” under two statutes—**Private Fund, Registered Fund, Administered Fund, Licensed Fund and the Limited‑Investor Fund exemption**—plus an optional **Segregated Portfolio Company (SPC)** overlay.  All are quick to form, but each label toggles a different mix of CIMA fees, investor‑qualification rules, audit duty, and service‑provider burdens.  Below you’ll find (i) the statutory requirements and exact application forms, (ii) the 1 January 2025 government fees now in force, (iii) realistic first‑year professional budgets, (iv) where these entities are actually banking (Cayman, U.S. fintech rails, Switzerland & Liechtenstein), and (v) a 20‑point comparison matrix to benchmark them side‑by‑side.

## 1 Regulatory backdrop

Cayman funds are governed by the **Mutual Funds Act (Revised 2025)** for *open‑ended* vehicles and by the **Private Funds Act (2024 Revision)** for *closed‑ended* vehicles.  Both statutes delegate licensing and ongoing supervision to the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) via the REEFS e‑portal, which hosts all fund application forms. ([CIMA][1], [CIMA][2])

---

## 2 Core structures in detail

### 2.1 Private Fund (closed‑ended)

* **Who it suits** VC, credit or liquid‑token strategies that do **not** offer voluntary redemptions.
* **Key filings** REEFS “Private Fund Registration” package (PF application + FAR enrolment). ([Conyers][3])
* **Government fees** US \$365 application + US \$4 270 annual renewal (2025 rate). ([CIMA][4], [Lexology][5])
* **Professional budget** c.US \$25 – 50 k for a plain‑vanilla ELP (LPA, AML manual, directors).
* **Complexities** must file audited statements and FAR within six months of FYE; two‑director minimum; 21‑day clock from first commitment to filing. ([Lexology][5])
* **Blockchain example** **Pantera Blockchain Offshore Fund LP** (ELP, private‑fund certificate dated 2024).

### 2.2 Registered Mutual Fund (s 4(3))

* **Who it suits** Liquid hedge or index funds with weekly/monthly redemptions.
* **Eligibility** either a **US \$100 k minimum initial subscription** or a listing on a CIMA‑approved exchange. ([CIMA][6])
* **Forms** **MF1** + Offering Memorandum upload. ([CIMA][7])
* **Fees** US \$366 application + US \$4 268 annual. ([CIMA][8])
* **Professional budget** \~US \$30 – 60 k (fund docs, Cayman admin, listing agent if used).
* **Complexities** annual audit, FAR, director registration under the Directors Registration & Licensing Act. ([Lexology][9])
* **Example** **Bitwise 10 Index Offshore Fund** (crypto index feeder; Reg. Fund).

### 2.3 Administered Mutual Fund (s 4(1)(b))

* **Who it suits** Funds that keep a **licensed Cayman administrator** but want lighter CIMA interaction.
* **Forms** **MF2/MF2A** (administrator’s affidavit replaces the US \$100 k test). ([CIMA][2])
* **Fees** identical to Registered Fund (US \$366 + US \$4 268).
* **Extra duty** administrator must file a monthly NAV report to CIMA.

### 2.4 Licensed Mutual Fund (s 4(1)(a))

* **Retail‑friendly** full licence—no subscription minimum.
* **Forms** **MF3**, business‑plan & fit‑and‑proper questionnaires. ([CIMA][2])
* **Fees** US \$4 482 initial + US \$4 482 annual (2025).
* **Professional budget** US \$60 – 120 k (prospectus drafting, custodian & compliance infrastructure).
* **Complexities** mandatory Cayman custodian, three independent directors, pre‑clearance of marketing materials. ([CIMA][2])

### 2.5 Limited‑Investor Fund exemption (≤15 holders)

* **Statutory basis** Mutual Funds Act s 4(4).
* **Forms** App‑101‑78 limited‑investor filing (no OM). ([CIMA][2])
* **Fees** US \$4 268 annual (same as Registered).
* **Use‑case** family offices, proof‑of‑concept crypto strat before scaling.

### 2.6 Segregated Portfolio Company (SPC) overlay

Adds statutory ring‑fenced “cells” to any company fund.

* **Fee** US \$610 one‑off + US \$1 463 annual base + US \$305 per cell. ([Lexology][10])
* **Complexity** audit and NAV reporting per cell; cross‑cell insolvency rules.

## 7 Practical take‑aways

1. **Match the redemption profile to the statute:** if you need daily/weekly liquidity, you must live under the Mutual Funds Act; closed‑ended token VC funds belong under the Private Funds Act.
2. **Budget beyond CIMA fees:** the US \$365 filing fee is trivial—the real spend is the legal drafting, audit and Cayman directors (US \$10 k + p.a.).
3. **Pre‑clear banking early:** Cayman banks still ask for six‑figure deposits from crypto‑heavy funds; many managers pair a *local* Butterfield operating account with *U.S.* CBIT rails for 24/7 settlement. ([butterfieldgroup.com][13], [ULAM LABS][14])
4. **Don’t forget director registration:** company‑based Registered and Licensed Funds need directors registered or licensed under the DRL Act before launch. ([Lexology][9])
5. **SPC solves strategy sprawl:** if you plan multiple token sleeves, build the SPC status at inception—the per‑cell fee (US \$305) is cheaper than launching new entities later. ([Lexology][10])
