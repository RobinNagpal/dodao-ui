## A) Anchor selection

For CRH, the **PRIMARY anchor should be EV/EBITDA**, because this is a capital-intensive, asset-heavy building materials business where the market usually cares most about (1) the cash-earning power of the asset base before financing and taxes, and (2) the company’s ability to run quarries/cement/asphalt networks at high utilization with pricing discipline. EBITDA is a practical proxy for that “through-cycle operating earning power,” and it lines up well with how large diversified materials platforms are valued, especially when capital structure moves around due to acquisitions and buybacks. Anchors like **P/S** are less suitable right now because pricing (and therefore revenue) can move with inflation while profitability can move differently depending on energy and logistics costs, so sales multiples can look “better” or “worse” without telling you if value per share is really improving.

**CROSS-CHECK anchor #1 is P/E (and forward P/E)** because it is the most direct way to connect the story back to **per-share outcomes**, which matters for CRH given its consistent share reduction (FY 2024 shares fell about **-5.4%**, and the latest quarters still show share count drifting down). P/E is often more informative than EV/EBITDA when you want to understand what equity holders actually receive after interest expense, taxes, and minority interests, and when capital allocation is a core part of the thesis. In plain terms, if management keeps shrinking share count while growing net income modestly, EPS can compound faster than total profit, and P/E makes that mechanical advantage visible.

**CROSS-CHECK anchor #2 is P/FCF (or FCF yield)** because it catches the biggest blind spot in both EV/EBITDA and P/E for this company: **cash conversion can swing** due to capex intensity, working-capital needs, and acquisition spending. CRH’s free cash flow margin has been uneven (for example, FY 2024 FCF was about **$2.4B on $35.6B revenue ≈ ~6.8%**, while FY 2023 was **~9.2%**), so a valuation story that looks fine on EBITDA or EPS can still disappoint if cash generation per share lags. This second check is essential precisely because building materials can look “smooth” on income statement metrics while cash flow gets pulled around by growth capex, plant upgrades, and the timing of receivables/payables in a construction-driven cycle.

## B) The 3–4 driver framework

**Driver 1: Revenue growth (volume + price) in CRH’s local-heavy markets.** This matters because, in aggregates/cement/asphalt, a large portion of costs are fixed or semi-fixed at the asset level, so incremental volume and price typically lift EBITDA dollars meaningfully when utilization is healthy. A numeric anchor is that CRH’s revenue grew from about **$25.9B (FY 2020)** to **$35.6B (FY 2024)**, which is a strong multi-year climb even though the most recent year (FY 2024) was only **~+1.8%**. This driver directly impacts **EV/EBITDA** because higher revenue, if not fully offset by costs, pushes EBITDA higher; it also impacts **P/E** because sustained revenue growth usually supports steady EPS growth when fixed costs are leveraged.

**Driver 2: EBITDA and EBIT margin (pricing discipline minus energy/labor/transport inflation).** This is the core “quality” lever for a vertically integrated materials player: the business wins when it can push price increases through local oligopolies (especially aggregates near demand centers) while containing energy and operating costs in cement/asphalt and logistics. The historical numeric anchor is visible in margins: EBITDA margin improved from roughly **~16.6% (FY 2020)** to **~18.9% (FY 2024)**, and EBIT margin rose from **~10.4%** to **~13.9%** over the same period. Margin expansion matters most to the **EV/EBITDA anchor** (it is the cleanest driver of EBITDA growth without requiring heroic top-line growth), and it supports **P/E** through higher operating income translating into higher net income per share.

**Driver 3: Free cash flow conversion (capex + working capital), expressed as FCF margin and FCF per share.** For CRH, cash is not just a byproduct—it’s the fuel for buybacks, dividends, and bolt-on acquisitions, so FCF conversion decides whether per-share value actually compounds. A useful numeric anchor is capex and FCF behavior: FY 2024 capex was about **$2.6B** (roughly **~7% of sales**), and FY 2024 FCF margin was **~6.8%**, which is meaningfully below FY 2023’s **~9.2%**; that gap shows how quickly cash conversion can move even if the income statement looks stable. This driver is what the **P/FCF anchor** is explicitly testing, and it also indirectly influences **P/E** because stronger cash conversion reduces the need for debt and supports consistent buybacks without balance-sheet strain.

**Driver 4: Capital allocation and leverage (buybacks, acquisitions, and net debt), which changes per-share compounding.** CRH has been aggressively shrinking share count (FY 2024 shares down **~5.4%**), which can materially lift EPS even if total earnings only grow modestly, but the trade-off is that acquisitions and buybacks can push net debt higher and raise risk if the cycle turns. The numeric baseline shows this tension: total debt rose from about **$15.6B (FY 2024)** to roughly **$20.7B (Q3 2025)**, and net cash is negative (net debt position) around **~$11.8B** in FY 2024 and **~$16.5B** by Q3 2025, while net debt/EBITDA has been around **~2.1× (FY 2024)** and recently showed **~2.6×**. This driver affects **EV/EBITDA** through the risk/multiple investors are willing to pay, and it affects **P/E** by shaping interest expense, financial flexibility, and the sustainability of buyback-driven EPS growth.

## C) Baseline snapshot

On a latest annual baseline (FY 2024), CRH generated about **$35.6B revenue**, **$6.7B EBITDA** (EBITDA margin **~18.9%**), **$4.9B EBIT** (EBIT margin **~13.9%**), and about **$3.5B net income**, translating to **~$5.06 EPS**. Free cash flow was about **$2.4B** (FCF margin **~6.8%**) or roughly **~$3.50 FCF per share** in that year, while the company also paid roughly **$1.40 per share** in dividends and reduced shares meaningfully. Today’s equity pricing implies a richer valuation than FY 2024’s year-end: the market snapshot shows a trailing P/E around **~25×** and the recent ratio set shows **EV/EBITDA ~13–14×**, which means the “starting point” for a 3-year multiplier is not cheap.

Over the last 3–5 years, the direction has been favorable on operating profitability, with revenue rising from roughly **$25.9B (FY 2020)** to **$35.6B (FY 2024)** and EBITDA climbing from **~$4.3B** to **~$6.7B**, while EBITDA margin improved from **~16.6%** to **~18.9%**. At the same time, cash conversion has been less smooth: FCF margin moved from about **~11.4% (FY 2020)** to **~8.3% (FY 2021)** to **~7.0% (FY 2022)** to **~9.2% (FY 2023)** and then down to **~6.8% (FY 2024)**, which is consistent with a business that can generate strong cash but also absorbs cash in capex, working capital, and acquisitions. The share count trend is a clear per-share tailwind (persistent reductions), but the balance sheet has also carried meaningful net debt, so the trend implies CRH can create operating leverage and per-share compounding, but it must avoid letting leverage and cash conversion become the limiting factors in a “similar regime” environment.

## D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”

A **2× return in ~3 years** requires roughly **~26% per year** compounded, because “about one-quarter per year” stacks to roughly a doubling over three years. In a broadly similar macro regime, that kind of return usually cannot come only from a mild valuation lift; it generally requires a big increase in **per-share fundamentals** (EPS and/or FCF per share) plus at least stable valuation, or a strong fundamental improvement combined with a smaller valuation tailwind. For CRH specifically, “2×” means the market must believe that EBITDA, EPS, and FCF per share will be materially higher and durable, and that leverage and cyclicality risks are contained—otherwise multiples tend to compress rather than expand.

Under the **EV/EBITDA primary anchor**, a 2× equity move would need something like a large EBITDA increase plus a stable-to-higher EV/EBITDA multiple, or a very large EBITDA increase if the multiple falls. Plain-English math: if EV/EBITDA stayed flat, you’d need EV to roughly double, which implies **EBITDA roughly doubling**; if EBITDA rose “only” ~30–50% (already a lot for a mature materials platform), then EV/EBITDA would have to expand meaningfully to make up the gap, which is hard if rates and cyclicality stay similar. Under the **P/E cross-check**, a 2× price with a similar P/E requires **EPS to nearly double**, which means net income per share must compound close to that ~26% annual pace—possible in small fast growers, but ambitious for heavy materials unless there is a major cycle upswing. Under the **P/FCF cross-check**, a 2× price with a similar cash yield requires **FCF per share to roughly double**, and if the market demands a higher FCF yield (a lower P/FCF) for cyclicality risk, FCF per share would need to rise even more.

Based on CRH’s own history, the **most likely** next-3-year driver ranges look more like steady compounding than a step-change. Revenue growth has recently moderated (FY 2024 was only **~+1.8%**, while trailing revenue is up about **~+4%**), so a conservative base case is **~3% to ~6% per year** (roughly **~1.09× to ~1.19×** over three years), reflecting a mix of modest volume plus pricing that tracks inflation in local markets. Margin expansion has been real (EBITDA margin from **~16.6% to ~18.9%** over several years), but it is harder to repeat at the same pace, so a reasonable base case is **flat to +1.0 percentage point** EBITDA margin over three years (for example, **~19% to ~20%**), which still supports EBITDA growth without assuming heroic demand. For cash conversion, given FY 2024’s weaker FCF margin (**~6.8%**) versus FY 2023 (**~9.2%**), a conservative range is normalization toward **~7.5% to ~9.5%** FCF margin if acquisition integration and capex intensity stabilize, but not assuming a return to peak levels every year. For share count, the company has proven it can buy back stock aggressively, but with net debt rising (net cash more negative in 2025), the conservative assumption is **~1% to ~2% annual share reduction** (roughly **~3% to ~6%** over three years) rather than repeating **~5%+** reductions indefinitely.

Industry logic and CRH’s business position support those “steady” ranges, but they also argue against assuming a sudden acceleration. The local nature of aggregates and the permitting barriers do support pricing power, so **mid-single-digit** revenue growth can be plausible even without a boom, because a portion can come from price/mix and infrastructure demand that is less rate-sensitive than housing. However, cement and energy-linked inputs can pressure costs, and construction is cyclical, so it is conservative to assume margins do not expand dramatically from already-improved levels unless utilization tightens materially. CRH’s scale and vertical integration help protect margins in normal conditions, but in a similar regime, competitors are also rational and customers push back when volumes soften, so assuming **+2 to +3 margin points** would be optimistic. On capital allocation, CRH’s buyback history supports ongoing per-share help, but the rise in total debt and net debt suggests the pace of buybacks is constrained by balance-sheet discipline; in practical terms, that means per-share compounding is real, but it is unlikely to be so large that it alone drives a doubling.

Comparing “required” versus “likely” outcomes shows the gap clearly across all three anchors. On **EV/EBITDA**, a 2× in three years usually wants something close to **~2× EBITDA** if multiples don’t expand, but the likely path looks closer to **~1.15× to ~1.35× EBITDA** (mid-single-digit revenue growth plus modest margin change), and multiples from today’s richer level are more likely to be flat-to-down than up. On **P/E**, a 2× price with today’s P/E needs EPS close to **~2×**, while the likely EPS outcome (net income growth plus modest buybacks) is closer to **~1.25× to ~1.55×**, and a P/E that is already elevated versus recent years is more likely to drift lower in a similar regime. On **P/FCF**, a 2× price needs FCF per share close to **~2×**, but a conservative normalization story typically gets you more like **~1.2× to ~1.6×**, and cash-yield expectations can tighten if the cycle weakens. **Net: fundamentals imply ~1.3× to ~1.7×; 2× requires unusually strong volume/pricing plus sustained margin expansion and no valuation mean-reversion, which are above history/industry/business reality.**

## E) Business reality check

Operationally, CRH “wins” by keeping its **local materials networks tight**: maximizing quarry and plant utilization where it has advantaged locations, pushing disciplined pricing that reflects scarcity and transport economics, and expanding value-added Building Products where it can bundle solutions and earn higher margins. To hit the base-case ranges above, it does not need a construction boom; it needs steady mid-single-digit revenue growth driven by price/mix plus selective volume, while holding the cost line so EBITDA margin stays around **~19–20%** rather than slipping back. It also needs capex to normalize closer to a steady maintenance-and-growth level (FY 2024 capex was about **~$2.6B**, higher than some prior years), so that FCF margin can move back toward **~8–10%** without starving the asset base.

The most realistic failure modes map directly to the drivers. If residential and non-residential demand soften together (rates stay high and private construction slows), volumes can drop, and in heavy materials that can pressure margins quickly because fixed costs get spread over fewer tons, breaking the margin and EBITDA growth needed for the **EV/EBITDA** path. If energy costs spike or cement/asphalt cost inflation outpaces pricing power, EBITDA margins can stall or compress, again hurting the primary anchor even if revenue holds up. If acquisitions remain large and frequent, cash conversion can stay weak and leverage can rise, which would hurt the **P/FCF** anchor and often causes the market to demand lower multiples because cyclicality plus leverage is a toxic combo. And if buybacks slow sharply to protect the balance sheet, the per-share lift embedded in the **P/E** story fades, making it much harder to reach an aggressive multiplier.

Putting the business logic and numbers together, the base-case path looks **plausible** as incremental execution but **not** plausible as a “double” without a step-change. The operating improvements required for ~1.3×–1.7× are consistent with what CRH has already done—steady pricing discipline, small margin improvements, and continued capital returns—while recognizing that FCF and leverage can move around year-to-year. In contrast, a true 2× in three years would require a combination of faster growth, stronger and sustained margin expansion, and unusually supportive valuation behavior all at once, which is effectively a “best-of-all-worlds” setup rather than the conservative, similar-regime outcome.

## F) Multi-anchor triangulation

### 1. Primary anchor

On the **EV/EBITDA** baseline, CRH’s FY 2024 EBITDA was about **$6.7B** (margin **~18.9%**), and recent valuation readings imply an EV/EBITDA that has moved into the **~13–14×** area in the latest period versus **~11×** at FY 2024 year-end. This matters because you are starting from a relatively full multiple for a cyclical materials company, which reduces the chance that multiple expansion is a major return driver. It also matters that enterprise value sits above equity value by net debt; if net debt rises, equity can underperform even when EBITDA rises.

For the next three years, a conservative input set is revenue growth **~3–6% per year** (≈ **~1.09× to ~1.19×** over three years), EBITDA margin **flat to +1.0 point** (e.g., **~19% to ~20%**) because CRH already improved margins materially and further gains are harder, and net debt held roughly stable-to-slightly-down if management prioritizes balance-sheet discipline after recent debt increases. These are reasonable because CRH’s past shows it can grow revenue and improve margins, but FY 2024’s slower growth and higher debt argue for moderation, while the industry structure (local oligopolies, transport constraints) supports pricing resilience without requiring a boom.

Putting that into plain-English math, EBITDA might grow roughly **~1.15× to ~1.35×** (mid-single-digit sales growth plus modest margin help), while the EV/EBITDA multiple is more likely **flat-to-down** from today’s richer level (for example, **~0.85× to ~1.00×** if it drifts toward more normal levels). That implies enterprise value growth of roughly **~1.0× to ~1.3×**; if net debt is stable and buybacks reduce share count modestly, the equity per-share outcome can land around **~1.1× to ~1.4×**. The low end happens if volumes soften and the multiple mean-reverts downward; the high end happens if pricing stays strong, margins hold near the top of the recent range, and valuation does not compress.

### 2. Cross-check anchor #1

On the **P/E** baseline, CRH earned about **$5.06 EPS** in FY 2024 and is trading around a **mid-20s** P/E today (market snapshot shows about **~24–25×**, with forward P/E around **~21×**). That is meaningfully higher than the company’s own FY 2023–FY 2024 year-end P/E levels in the mid-teens, which signals that the market has already “pulled forward” some optimism about durability and growth. Because this is a per-share anchor, it automatically includes the benefit of buybacks and the drag (or benefit) of financing costs.

A conservative three-year EPS input is net income growth **~5–10% per year** (driven by mid-single-digit revenue growth and stable-to-slightly-better margins) plus share count reduction **~1–2% per year**, which mechanically adds a few points to EPS growth if buybacks continue. This is reasonable because CRH’s historical share reductions have been larger, but rising net debt suggests the company may not repeat the most aggressive pace without stressing the balance sheet. It also fits industry logic: building materials can compound earnings in normal times, but it rarely delivers persistent 20%+ EPS growth unless the cycle is unusually strong.

In plain-English math, EPS could plausibly grow about **~1.25× to ~1.55×** over three years (think “~8–15% annual EPS growth” when you combine profit growth and modest buybacks). If the P/E multiple is **flat to modestly lower** from today (say **~0.85× to ~1.00×**), the price outcome becomes roughly **~1.1× to ~1.55×**, and adding a small dividend yield (~1%ish) nudges total return slightly higher. The low end occurs if the market re-rates the stock back toward a more normal mid-to-high teens multiple while EPS grows only modestly; the high end occurs if EPS compounds in the mid-teens and the P/E holds near today’s elevated level.

### 3. Cross-check anchor #2

On the **P/FCF (FCF yield)** baseline, FY 2024 FCF was about **$2.4B** or **~$3.50 per share**, which at a ~$120+ stock price implies a low-single-digit FCF yield (equivalently, a **high P/FCF**, which the recent ratio set reflects). This is a crucial starting point: when the market prices a cyclical company at a low FCF yield, it is implicitly assuming cash flows are durable and/or set to improve, leaving less room for valuation-driven upside. This anchor also forces you to deal with the reality that FY 2024 FCF margin (**~6.8%**) was not especially strong relative to earlier peaks.

A conservative three-year cash input is that FCF margin normalizes to **~7.5% to ~9.5%** as capex intensity and working capital stabilize, with revenue growing **~3–6% per year**, and share count declining modestly **~1–2% per year** so FCF per share grows a bit faster than total FCF. This is reasonable because CRH’s history shows FCF can sit around the high single digits in good years (FY 2023 was ~9%), but FY 2024 was weaker and acquisitions can keep cash conversion choppy. Industry logic supports stable cash generation in repair/remodel and infrastructure, but cement/asphalt and construction cycles make it prudent not to assume peak cash conversion every year.

In plain-English math, total FCF might grow roughly **~1.15× to ~1.45×** (sales growth plus modest margin normalization), and per share it could be **~1.2× to ~1.55×** with buybacks. If the market demands a **somewhat higher** FCF yield over time (meaning P/FCF compresses) because of cyclicality and leverage, the valuation multiplier could be **<1.0×**, limiting price upside even when cash improves; if the market stays comfortable with a low FCF yield, the price can track the FCF per-share gain more closely. The low end happens if FCF remains choppy and valuation tightens; the high end happens if FCF conversion improves steadily and valuation holds.

---

## G) Valuation sanity check

Valuation is more likely a **headwind to neutral** than a tailwind, because today’s multiples look elevated versus the company’s own recent history. The market snapshot indicates a trailing P/E around **~25×** (forward **~21×**), while CRH’s year-end P/E in FY 2023–FY 2024 was in the **mid-teens to high-teens**, and EV/EBITDA has risen from roughly **~11× (FY 2024 year-end)** to roughly **~13–14×** recently. In practical terms, that means even good fundamental execution can be partially offset if the market simply “gives back” some of the re-rating that already happened.

In a conservative “similar regime” setup, a reasonable valuation multiplier over three years is roughly **~0.85× to ~1.05×**, reflecting a mild chance of mean reversion (especially if the cycle cools) and a smaller chance that the market maintains today’s premium if results stay steady and infrastructure demand supports confidence. The upper bound stays capped because it is hard to justify a meaningfully higher multiple for a cyclical materials business without a regime shift, and your own constraint is to avoid assuming that kind of structural re-rating. The lower bound acknowledges that if growth slows or leverage stays elevated, investors typically demand more yield and less multiple for cyclicals.

---

## H) Final answer

Most likely, CRH’s **3-year price multiplier is ~1.3× to ~1.7×**, because the company can plausibly compound EPS and EBITDA in the high single digits to low teens annually (helped by modest buybacks) while valuation is more likely to be flat or slightly lower from today’s elevated starting point. That mix supports solid returns, but it usually does not stack to a doubling without unusually favorable conditions.

A reasonable bull-case is **~1.7× to ~2.0×**, but it requires multiple things to go right at once: revenue growth sustaining nearer the top of the conservative band (closer to mid-to-high single digits), EBITDA margins holding at the high end or improving modestly, FCF conversion normalizing toward the high end of the recent range, and buybacks remaining meaningfully supportive without pushing leverage higher. Just as importantly, it requires **little to no valuation mean reversion** from today’s richer multiples, because if the multiple compresses, even strong fundamental growth struggles to reach 2×.

**Borderline.** Quarterly revenue growth (YoY, %); pricing vs volume split (management disclosure, %/%); EBITDA margin (%); EBIT margin (%); capex as % of sales (%); FCF margin (% of sales) and FCF per share ($); net debt to EBITDA (×) and interest expense run-rate ($); share count change (YoY, %); ROIC/ROCE (%).
