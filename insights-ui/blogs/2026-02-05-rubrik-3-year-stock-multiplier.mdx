## A) Anchor selection

For Rubrik today, the cleanest **PRIMARY anchor is EV/Revenue (EV/Sales)** because the company is still structurally in “scale-first” mode: it has strong gross margins (recent quarters ~79%–81%) but is not yet consistently profitable at the operating line (recent operating margin still roughly **-22% to -30%**). In that situation, earnings-based anchors like P/E or EV/EBITDA can mislead because the “E” is still negative and heavily influenced by growth spending and stock-based compensation. EV/Revenue is how most public markets first value high-growth, subscription-heavy security/data software—especially when revenue is recurring and retention is high—because it converts the business story into a measurable question: “How fast and how durable is the recurring revenue stream, and what margin profile can it mature into?”

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #1 is EV/Gross Profit** (EV divided by revenue times gross margin). It becomes more informative than EV/Revenue when two companies have similar top-line growth but very different unit economics, or when gross margin is shifting because of cloud-hosting costs, mix (SaaS vs self-managed), or pricing/discounting. For Rubrik specifically, gross margin is already high and has expanded to around **~80%** in the most recent quarters, so EV/Gross Profit helps you see whether valuation is being paid for “true software-like economics” (high gross profit dollars that can later fund operating profit) rather than just headline revenue growth.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #2 is P/FCF (or EV/FCF)**, used cautiously as a reality check because it catches the biggest blind spot in revenue multiples: **cash conversion and dilution**. Rubrik’s free cash flow has recently looked strong in quarterly snapshots (recent FCF margins near **~20%+**), but for subscription software that can be temporarily flattered by billings timing, deferred revenue swings, and working-capital movements. P/FCF forces the discussion back to “per-share cash the business can ultimately produce,” and it also makes dilution unavoidable: if stock-based compensation is large (and Rubrik’s recent quarters show very large SBC), the cash flow may look fine while per-share value creation lags.

## B) The 3–4 driver framework

**Driver 1: Revenue growth and durability (especially subscription expansion).** The valuation anchors EV/Revenue and EV/Gross Profit are directly proportional to revenue (and gross profit) per share, so the first-order question is whether Rubrik can sustain high growth as it scales past roughly **~$1.2B LTM revenue** with recent growth around **~49%–51% YoY**. That growth is plausible in cyber resilience because ransomware risk and hybrid-cloud complexity keep budgets “non-discretionary,” but it becomes harder as the base gets larger and competition (Veeam/Cohesity/Commvault and cloud-native alternatives) tightens. If growth cools from ~50% toward a more mature **~25%–35%** range, EV/Revenue can still work, but only if the market believes the revenue is sticky (your **132% net dollar retention** datapoint supports that stickiness) and if margins improve enough to justify staying in a premium multiple band.

**Driver 2: Gross margin level and stability (unit economics quality).** Recent gross margin is already in a “real SaaS” zone (**~79%–81%** in the last two quarters), which matters because it means incremental revenue carries a lot of gross profit dollars that can later fund operating leverage. EV/Gross Profit is effectively EV/Revenue adjusted for that margin, so if gross margin were to slip (for example, from higher cloud costs or heavier discounting), EV/Revenue might look stable while EV/Gross Profit quietly deteriorates. Conversely, if gross margin stays near ~80% while revenue scales, it supports the idea that Rubrik can grow without “buying” revenue through structurally worse economics, which is a key reason markets will pay up for security software in the first place.

**Driver 3: Operating leverage (S&M and R&D scaling) and the path toward breakeven.** Even when investors use revenue multiples, what really moves the multiple is confidence about the future margin structure. Rubrik’s most recent quarters show operating margin still negative (**about -22% to -30%**), but that is far less extreme than the latest annual snapshot, which appears distorted by very large costs and likely one-time/IPO-era items. The business logic is straightforward: if revenue keeps compounding and gross margin is ~80%, then over time Sales & Marketing and R&D should become a smaller percentage of revenue if customer acquisition becomes more efficient and the product matures. If that operating loss narrows materially, EV/Revenue can stay stable or even rise modestly; if it does not, the market usually compresses the multiple as growth normalizes.

**Driver 4: Share count change (dilution) and capital structure effects on per-share outcomes.** Your per-share requirement is critical here because Rubrik’s share count has expanded sharply over time (for example, annual shares outstanding moved from roughly **~60M** earlier in the history you provided to about **~200M** recently), and current quarters still show meaningful stock-based compensation. Even if enterprise value rises with revenue, the stock can underperform if that value is spread across a rising share base. Separately, Rubrik currently shows net cash (recent net cash around **~$0.4B**), so leverage is not the core driver; the bigger per-share swing factor is whether dilution slows to a “normal public SaaS” pace (say low-single-digits per year) or remains meaningfully higher.

## C) Baseline snapshot

Using your provided fundamentals and today’s tape, Rubrik is roughly a **~$10–12B equity** story with about **~200M shares** outstanding and LTM revenue around **~$1.2B** growing close to **~50% YoY**. The most recent reported quarters show gross margin around **~79%–81%**, operating margin still negative (**~ -22% to -30%**), and free cash flow that has been notably positive in the last two quarters (roughly **~$61M** and **~$81M**), which annualizes to a few hundred million if it held—but that “if it held” is exactly why we keep it as a cross-check rather than the primary anchor. On valuation, the most useful “right-now” framing is that EV/Revenue is in the high-single-digits area (roughly **~8–9×**), which is consistent with a high-growth security SaaS name that is still proving durable profitability.

The 3–5 year trend in the numbers you provided is a classic scale-up profile: revenue has risen from roughly **~$388M (FY2021)** to **~$887M (FY2025)**, and the latest LTM is about **~$1.2B**, with growth re-accelerating in the most recent quarters near **~50%**. Gross margin has moved from around **~70%** earlier to about **~80%** recently, which is a meaningful qualitative improvement because it increases the probability of eventual operating leverage. Meanwhile, profitability on an accounting basis remains negative, and the share count has increased dramatically over the period, implying that “company momentum” is strong but “per-share momentum” depends heavily on whether Rubrik can keep growth while reducing cash burn _and_ moderating dilution.

## D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”

A **2× move in 3 years** implies roughly **~26% per year** compounded (because ~26% per year for three years lands near ~2.0×). In a “similar regime” (no dramatic re-rating from macro), that kind of return usually cannot come from multiple expansion alone; it typically needs the underlying per-share fundamentals to do most of the work. For Rubrik, that means some combination of **revenue per share compounding strongly** (growth minus dilution), **credible margin improvement** (so the market continues to pay a premium revenue multiple), and **cash conversion improving enough** that investors feel the business is becoming self-funding rather than perpetually equity-funded.

Looking at the anchors, the hurdle is easiest to see in plain-English math. On **EV/Revenue (primary)**, if the EV/Revenue multiple stays roughly stable (say around today’s high-single-digits), then equity value per share roughly tracks **revenue per share**; to reach ~2×, you’d need something like **~2× revenue per share** over 3 years, which might mean ~30%+ annual revenue growth _and_ modest dilution. On **EV/Gross Profit**, the logic is similar because gross margin is already high; to get 2× without a multiple lift, you again need gross profit per share to roughly double, which usually requires sustained high growth plus stable margins. On **P/FCF**, the hurdle is tougher because as companies mature, markets often reduce P/FCF multiples; so to reach 2× on this anchor, Rubrik likely needs **FCF per share** to rise substantially _and_ the market to keep paying a relatively rich cash multiple—meaning FCF must become not just positive, but clearly durable and not overly dependent on working-capital timing.

From Rubrik’s own recent history, the **most likely** 3-year driver ranges look like this when kept conservative. Revenue growth is unlikely to stay near ~50% for three straight years off a ~$1.2B base in a competitive market, but it is plausible to average **~25% to ~35%** if net retention stays strong and new-logo wins continue; that translates to about **~1.95× to ~2.46×** revenue growth over 3 years. Gross margin is already ~80%, so a reasonable assumption is **~78% to ~82%** (small drift, not a heroic jump). Operating losses should narrow if scale benefits show up, but assuming a move all the way to strong profitability in 3 years is aggressive; a conservative path is operating margin improving from roughly **~-25%** toward something like **~-5% to +5%** by year three. For dilution, given the heavy stock-based compensation footprint and the already-large share base, a realistic assumption is **~3% to ~5% per year** share count growth, which is about **~1.09× to ~1.16×** more shares over three years.

Industry and positioning logic supports those “likely” ranges but also caps them. Cyber resilience is a real budget priority, and Rubrik’s stickiness (switching costs + strong net retention) supports continued growth, but the space is crowded and increasingly convergent: customers will push for platform pricing, and hyperscalers’ native tools create a “good enough” baseline that can pressure price and sales cycles. That makes **~25%–35%** revenue CAGR plausible but makes **~40%+** sustained CAGR harder without either unusually strong product differentiation or a major competitor stumble. On margins, the fact that gross margin is already ~80% is a positive—there is room for operating leverage—but the company must prove it can reduce S&M intensity without slowing growth, which is a classic trade-off for security SaaS in competitive categories.

When you compare “required” versus “likely” across the three anchors, you can see where 2× becomes a stretch. Under **EV/Revenue**, if revenue grows ~2.05× over 3 years (a ~27% CAGR midpoint) and shares rise ~1.11× (a ~3.5% dilution midpoint), revenue per share rises ~**1.85×**; getting to **2×** then requires either a modest multiple tailwind (for example, EV/Revenue rising ~5%–10% because margins improve faster than expected) or slightly higher growth with slightly lower dilution. Under **EV/Gross Profit**, the story is nearly identical because gross margin is already high; 2× is feasible but tends to require “everything pretty good” rather than just “normal execution.” Under **P/FCF**, 2× is the hardest because even if FCF grows, the market may compress the multiple as Rubrik matures; that anchor tends to say you need a clearer, structurally higher FCF margin than the conservative path assumes. Net: fundamentals imply **~1.6× to ~2.0×** most likely; **2× requires** sustained ~30%+ revenue growth _and_ dilution staying closer to low-single-digits _and_ the market not compressing the revenue/FCF multiple as growth cools.

## E) Business reality check

Operationally, Rubrik “wins” on 3-year outcomes by doing a few non-heroic things consistently: it keeps **net retention** high by expanding within existing enterprises (more workloads protected, more cloud/SaaS coverage, more security features adopted), it maintains pricing discipline so gross margin stays around **~80%**, and it improves go-to-market efficiency so sales productivity rises and Sales & Marketing becomes a smaller percentage of revenue without stalling new-logo adds. If those happen together, the model naturally produces operating leverage because each new dollar of revenue already carries a lot of gross profit, and the required improvement is mainly about spending ratio discipline rather than inventing new economics.

The realistic constraints are the ones that typically break scale-up software stories. If competitors force heavier discounting or bundle pricing, gross margin can soften and the EV/Revenue story becomes less convincing even if revenue grows. If enterprise buying cycles lengthen or customers consolidate vendors, revenue growth can fall below the ~25%–35% range, which makes 2× hard without multiple expansion. And if stock-based compensation remains very high relative to revenue, per-share outcomes can lag: the company can “do well” operationally while the share base expands enough to dilute a meaningful portion of enterprise value creation.

Putting the business logic and numbers together, the conservative path to strong returns is plausible because the biggest ingredients are already visible—high gross margins, rapid growth, sticky product behavior—but the **2×** target starts to require “step-change execution” in at least one dimension. In practice that step-change is usually **sales efficiency plus dilution control**: if Rubrik can show operating losses narrowing _while_ maintaining high growth, the market can keep paying a premium EV/Revenue, and if dilution slows, that enterprise value accrues more directly to each share. If either of those fails, you can still get a solid outcome, but 2× becomes unlikely in a similar regime.

## F) Multi-anchor triangulation

**Primary anchor**

On the **EV/Revenue** anchor, the baseline is roughly **~$1.2B LTM revenue** and an EV/Revenue multiple in the **high-single-digits (~8–9×)** range, using the current share count near **~200M** and today’s price level. The reason this baseline is useful is that it reflects how the market is already pricing Rubrik’s combination of ~50% growth, high gross margin, and still-negative operating margin, without pretending that “earnings power” is already mature.

For the 3-year inputs, a conservative set is **~25%–35% revenue CAGR**, gross margin roughly stable (because EV/Revenue is the anchor, gross margin is a second-order effect here), **dilution ~3%–5% per year**, and a valuation stance that is mostly stable (EV/Revenue roughly flat to slightly down unless profitability improves faster than expected). The growth range is reasonable because it assumes deceleration from ~50% as the base grows, but it still respects the business context (sticky cyber resilience, high retention, subscription mix). The dilution range is reasonable because Rubrik is still using equity heavily to fund talent and growth, and public SaaS companies often run low-to-mid single-digit dilution unless they are aggressively offsetting with buybacks, which Rubrik is unlikely to prioritize while still scaling.

If revenue grows **~1.95× to ~2.46×** over 3 years and the share count grows **~1.09× to ~1.16×**, then revenue per share rises about **~1.68× to ~2.25×** (because you divide the revenue growth by the share growth). If the EV/Revenue multiple is roughly flat, that’s your core **fundamental multiplier**; if the multiple drifts down modestly as growth cools (say ~0.9×), the range becomes closer to **~1.5× to ~2.0×**, and if the multiple holds or slightly rises because operating losses shrink quickly, it can land closer to **~1.7× to ~2.3×**. The low end happens if growth decelerates faster than expected _and_ dilution stays elevated; the high end happens if growth remains above ~30% and dilution moderates while margins visibly improve.

**Cross-check anchor #1**

On **EV/Gross Profit**, the baseline metric is gross profit built from **~$1.2B revenue** and roughly **~80% gross margin**, implying gross profit around **~$1.0B** (order-of-magnitude), and an EV/Gross Profit multiple around the low-teens when EV is roughly **~$10B**. This anchor matters because it reflects the quality of Rubrik’s unit economics more directly; for software companies, long-run value is created by converting gross profit dollars into operating profit dollars, so gross profit is a closer “economic numerator” than revenue.

The 3-year inputs mirror the revenue case but explicitly include gross margin stability: **revenue CAGR ~25%–35%**, **gross margin ~78%–82%**, and **dilution ~3%–5% per year**. This is reasonable because gross margin is already high; the conservative assumption is not “it jumps,” but “it doesn’t break,” which is what you’d expect if Rubrik maintains pricing power and manages cloud delivery costs. Industry logic also supports stability rather than expansion: many mature SaaS companies hover in a stable gross margin band once they are scaled, and the bigger risk is competitive discounting or higher cloud costs, not some automatic structural uplift.

Because gross margin is assumed roughly stable, gross profit growth is roughly the same as revenue growth, so gross profit per share again rises about **~1.6× to ~2.2×** under conservative growth and dilution. The valuation multiple on EV/Gross Profit is likely to be somewhat steadier than EV/Revenue if gross margin remains high and operating losses narrow, but it can compress if the market decides the category is commoditizing. That gives a 3-year fundamental multiplier that is usually in the same neighborhood as the EV/Revenue result—roughly **~1.6× to ~2.1×**—with the low end driven by gross margin slippage (even a few points matters because it directly reduces gross profit dollars) and the high end driven by strong growth plus visible operating leverage that convinces investors the gross profit will translate into future operating profit.

**Cross-check anchor #2**

On **P/FCF (and EV/FCF)**, the baseline is trickier because the annual free cash flow in the latest full fiscal year snapshot was only about **~$31M**, while the most recent quarters show much higher quarterly FCF (roughly **~$61M** and **~$81M**), implying the run-rate has improved sharply. The market is effectively valuing Rubrik as if meaningful FCF is emerging, which is why the current P/FCF framing looks far more normal than the fiscal-year snapshot. This anchor is still essential because it asks a different question: “How much real cash per share will exist in three years after funding growth?”

For 3-year inputs, a conservative approach is to assume that the _sustainable_ FCF margin settles lower than the recent quarter spikes, because subscription businesses can show very strong quarters when billings and deferred revenue timing are favorable. A reasonable band is **~8%–12% FCF margin** by year three (not today, but as operating losses narrow), applied to the revenue range implied by **~25%–35% CAGR**, with **~3%–5% annual dilution**. That margin band is conservative because it does not assume “best-in-class” profitability while the company is still investing heavily; it assumes the company becomes more efficient but still prioritizes growth.

If revenue is roughly **~2.0×** in three years, then even a **~10% FCF margin** implies FCF dollars roughly **~2.0×** versus a normalized baseline, but the per-share outcome depends on dilution and on whether the market keeps paying a high cash-flow multiple. In many “similar regime” outcomes, P/FCF compresses as companies mature (investors demand a higher yield), so even if FCF per share rises ~1.6×–2.0×, the multiple can fall enough that the stock ends up closer to **~1.3×–1.8×** on this anchor. The low end happens if current FCF is partly timing-driven and normalizes down while dilution stays high; the high end happens if FCF proves durable (not just timing), operating losses vanish, and the market is willing to maintain a premium cash multiple for a still-growing security platform.

## G) Valuation sanity check

Valuation is best described as **neutral to mildly headwind** from here, mainly because Rubrik is already priced as a premium growth security SaaS name on revenue (high-single-digit EV/Revenue) while still showing negative operating margins. In a similar macro regime, revenue multiples typically drift down as growth decelerates unless profitability improves quickly enough to offset the “growth cooling” narrative. The fact that Rubrik’s gross margin is now ~80% helps, because it supports the credibility of eventual operating leverage, but the market will want proof—especially given the visible dilution footprint—before it expands the multiple.

A conservative 3-year valuation multiplier range is therefore something like **~0.9× to ~1.1×** on the revenue-style multiples: slight compression if growth cools faster than expected, modest stability or mild expansion if operating leverage shows up clearly. That range fits “broadly similar to today” because it does not assume a regime shift to exuberant SaaS re-rating, but it also respects that improving margins in a durable security category can keep multiples from collapsing even as the company scales.

## H) Final answer

Most likely, Rubrik’s **3-year stock price multiplier is ~1.6× to ~2.0×**, because a conservative path of **~25%–35% revenue CAGR** combined with **~3%–5% annual dilution** produces something like **~1.7×–2.2×** revenue-per-share growth, and a “similar regime” valuation multiple is more likely to be flat-to-slightly-down than dramatically higher. In other words, the business can compound strongly, but per-share outcomes are meaningfully capped by dilution and by the normal tendency for revenue multiples to stop expanding as the base gets larger.

In a bull case, a **~2.0× to ~2.4×** outcome is achievable, but it requires several things to go right at once: growth needs to stay closer to the high end of the plausible band (closer to ~35% than ~25%) because retention stays strong and competitive pressure does not force discounting; operating losses must narrow fast enough that investors gain confidence in a near-term path to breakeven; and dilution must moderate toward low-single-digits so that enterprise value creation shows up cleanly in revenue and cash flow _per share_.

**Borderline.** Track these quarterly to see whether the 2× path is forming: YoY subscription revenue growth rate (%); net dollar retention rate (%) and gross retention rate (%); gross margin (%) with commentary on cloud delivery costs; Sales & Marketing as % of revenue and the implied sales efficiency trend; operating margin (%) and the pace of improvement versus prior quarters; free cash flow margin (%) and operating cash flow margin (%) to separate timing from durability; stock-based compensation as % of revenue (%) and the net change in diluted shares outstanding (% QoQ and % YoY); remaining performance obligations or deferred revenue growth (% YoY) as a forward demand proxy; net cash (cash + short-term investments – total debt) in dollars to confirm the balance sheet remains a support rather than a constraint.
