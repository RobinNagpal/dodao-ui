Got it—here are **15 acronym-style, easy-to-apply frameworks from individual investors/authors**:

1. **CAN SLIM — William O’Neil**
Growth stocks with strong **C**urrent & **A**nnual EPS, something **N**ew, favorable **S**upply/demand, **L**eadership, **I**nstitutional support, and a rising **M**arket. *Buy breakouts; cut losses fast.*

2. **VCP — Mark Minervini**
**V**olatility **C**ontraction **P**attern in leading stocks. *Wait for successive, tighter pullbacks; buy the breakout with tight risk.*

3. **SEPA — Mark Minervini**
**S**pecific **E**ntry **P**oint **A**nalysis. *Strong fundamentals + precise breakout entries + strict risk management.*

4. **PEG — Peter Lynch**
Price/Earnings-to-Growth. *Prefer PEG ≈ 1 (or less) for straightforward “growth at fair price.”*

5. **GARP — Peter Lynch / T. Rowe Price Jr.**
**G**rowth **A**t a **R**easonable **P**rice. *Solid earnings growth without overpaying; avoid story stocks.*

6. **Magic Formula (ROC + EY) — Joel Greenblatt**
Rank by high **R**eturn **o**n **C**apital and high **E**arnings **Y**ield. *Buy a basket of top ranks; rebalance periodically.*

7. **4Ms — Phil Town**
**M**eaning, **M**oat, **M**anagement, **M**argin of safety. *Only buy wonderful, understandable businesses well below value.*

8. **F-SCORE — Joseph Piotroski**
Nine simple checks of profitability, leverage, and efficiency. *From cheap stocks, pick those scoring ≥7/9.*

9. **Z-SCORE — Edward Altman**
Bankruptcy-risk filter. *Avoid (or short) firms with Z < \~1.8; prefer healthy balance sheets.*

10. **M-SCORE — Messod Beneish**
Earnings-manipulation risk. *Exclude high M-Score names from your buy list.*

11. **AM (Acquirer’s Multiple) — Tobias Carlisle**
EV/Operating Earnings (≈ EV/EBIT). *Own the lowest-multiple decile; be diversified and patient.*

12. **NCAV (Net-Net) — Benjamin Graham**
Price below **N**et **C**urrent **A**sset **V**alue. *Deep-value basket; expect many small wins and a few big ones.*

13. **CTS — Thomas Russo**
**C**apacity **T**o **S**uffer. *Back owner-operators willing to reinvest heavily for long-term dominance.*

14. **SES — Nick Sleep**
**S**cale **E**conomies **S**hared. *Favor firms that pass cost savings to customers to widen moats over time.*

15. **PP (Permanent Portfolio) — Harry Browne**
Simple, crisis-resilient allocation: 25% each **P**rocess (stocks), **P**rotection (long bonds), **P**recaution (cash), **P**recious (gold). *Rebalance annually.*

Want me to turn 3–5 of these into a **one-page screening checklist** (with example thresholds and a quick data-gathering flow)?



Perfect—here’s the updated **20-point, simple quantitative checklist** with the three requested items **replaced by easier, more actionable checks**. I also expanded every acronym directly in the Explanation column.

| #  | Simple check (how to compute)                                                                                                                             | Pass rule (edit to taste)                   | Validates                                | Explanation (simple)                                                                                                                                |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | **EPS YoY (ttm)** = Earnings-per-Share now vs a year ago                                                                                                  | **≥ +25%**                                  | CAN SLIM, VCP, SEPA, PEG, GARP           | **EPS** = profit per share. “ttm” = trailing-12-months. Big recent EPS growth means momentum in profits.                                            |
| 2  | **EPS 3-yr CAGR** from last 4 FY EPS                                                                                                                      | **≥ +15%**                                  | CAN SLIM, PEG, GARP, VCP, SEPA           | **CAGR** = average annual growth rate. Shows steady profit growth, not a one-off.                                                                   |
| 3  | **Sales 3-yr CAGR** from revenue                                                                                                                          | **≥ +10%**                                  | CAN SLIM, GARP, VCP, SEPA, CTS, SES      | Are customers buying more each year? Revenue growth is the engine for future earnings.                                                              |
| 4  | **Gross margin trend** = current GM% − last year                                                                                                          | **≥ 0 pp**                                  | 4Ms, CAN SLIM, VCP/SEPA                  | **Gross margin** = (Sales − Cost of Goods Sold) ÷ Sales. Stable/rising means pricing power or cost control.                                         |
| 5  | **Operating margin trend** = **EBIT**% YoY                                                                                                                | **≥ +1 pp**                                 | CAN SLIM, GARP, VCP/SEPA                 | **EBIT** = **Earnings Before Interest and Taxes** (profit from operations). Rising % means operations are improving.                                |
| 6  | **ROIC** ≈ **NOPAT** ÷ (Net PP\&E + Net Working Capital)                                                                                                  | **≥ 15%**                                   | Magic Formula, 4Ms, GARP                 | **ROIC** = **Return on Invested Capital**. **NOPAT** = **Net Operating Profit After Tax**. High ROIC = a quality business.                          |
| 7  | **ROE with low debt**: ROE and **D/E** ≤ 1.5                                                                                                              | **ROE ≥ 15%** & **Debt/Equity ≤ 1.5**       | 4Ms, CAN SLIM                            | **ROE** = **Return on Equity**. High ROE without heavy **D/E** (debt-to-equity) is safer quality.                                                   |
| 8  | **FCF margin** = (**CFO** − **Capex**) ÷ Sales                                                                                                            | **≥ 5%**                                    | 4Ms, Magic Formula, GARP                 | **FCF** = **Free Cash Flow**; **CFO** = **Cash Flow from Operations**; **Capex** = **Capital Expenditures**. Cash left after upkeep/growth.         |
| 9  | **Cash conversion** = **CFO** ÷ Net Income                                                                                                                | **≥ 1.0×**                                  | 4Ms                                      | Do accounting profits turn into cash? ≥1.0× means cash is keeping up with reported earnings.                                                        |
| 10 | **Interest cover** = **EBIT** ÷ Interest expense                                                                                                          | **≥ 4×**                                    | Z-style risk, 4Ms                        | Can operations easily pay interest? Higher multiple = lower stress.                                                                                 |
| 11 | **Net debt / EBITDA**                                                                                                                                     | **≤ 2.0×** (or net cash)                    | Z-style risk, F-Score (leverage), 4Ms    | **Net debt** = debt − cash. **EBITDA** = **Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization**. ≤2× = manageable debt.                   |
| 12 | **Asset-turnover trend** = Sales/Assets YoY                                                                                                               | **Rising**                                  | F-Score (ATO↑), SES                      | **Asset turnover** shows how efficiently assets generate sales. Rising = better use of resources.                                                   |
| 13 | **Shares outstanding YoY**                                                                                                                                | **Dilution ≤ 2%** (or shrinking)            | CAN SLIM (S), 4Ms, AM                    | Fewer new shares means your slice of the pie isn’t getting watered down; buybacks help.                                                             |
| 14 | **Quick Profit & Cash Health (3-in-1)**: (i) Net Income > 0, (ii) **CFO** > 0, (iii) **CFO** ≥ Net Income                                                 | **Pass ≥ 2 of 3**                           | Replaces **Piotroski F-Score** idea; 4Ms | Three easy green flags: profitable, cash-generative, and cash ≥ accounting profit. (**CFO** defined above.)                                         |
| 15 | **Liquidity cushion (Current Ratio)** = **Current Assets** ÷ **Current Liabilities**                                                                      | **≥ 1.5×**                                  | Replaces **Altman Z-Score** idea         | Simple solvency snapshot: enough near-term assets (cash, receivables, inventory) to cover near-term bills.                                          |
| 16 | **Quality-of-Earnings Lite**: (i) **Receivables growth − Sales growth** ≤ 5 pp, and (ii) **Accruals ratio** = (Net Income − **CFO**) ÷ Total Assets ≤ 10% | **Both true**                               | Replaces **Beneish M-Score** idea        | If receivables balloon faster than sales or **accruals** (profits without cash) are high, be cautious. (**Receivables** = money customers owe you.) |
| 17 | **Earnings Yield** = **EBIT** ÷ **EV**                                                                                                                    | **Top 30%** or **≥ 8%**                     | Magic Formula, AM                        | **EV** = **Enterprise Value** = market value of equity + debt − cash. Higher EY = cheaper for the cash profits (**EBIT**) you get.                  |
| 18 | **EV/EBIT**                                                                                                                                               | **≤ 12×** (or bottom 30%)                   | AM, Magic Formula                        | Flip of #17. Lower **Enterprise Value-to-EBIT** means paying less for operating profits.                                                            |
| 19 | **PEG** = (**P/E**) ÷ EPS growth (3-yr)                                                                                                                   | **≤ 1.5** (≤ 1.0 ideal)                     | PEG, GARP                                | **P/E** = **Price-to-Earnings**. PEG checks if the price you pay is fair for the growth you get. Lower = better value for growth.                   |
| 20 | **Reinvestment & scale test** = (R\&D + **Capex**) ÷ Sales **and** **SG\&A**% trend                                                                       | **Reinvest ≥ 8%** & **SG\&A**% falling 3-yr | CTS, SES                                 | **R\&D** = **Research & Development**. **SG\&A** = **Selling, General & Admin**. Investing to grow while overhead % shrinks = scale advantage.      |

### What changed (and why it’s better for simplicity)



###

Here are 20 celebrated investors and their bite-size playbooks (besides Raamdeo Agrawal). Use this as a quick scouting guide—then dig deeper before acting.

1. **Warren Buffett** — Buy *wonderful businesses at fair prices* inside your circle of competence; seek durable moats + margin of safety; hold for decades.
2. **Charlie Munger** — Favor *high-quality, fairly priced* compounders; apply multidisciplinary mental models; invert and avoid big mistakes.
3. **Benjamin Graham** — Be a *value buyer*: exploit “Mr. Market,” demand a margin of safety; historically hunted net-nets/asset bargains.
4. **Peter Lynch** — *Invest in what you know*; do scuttlebutt; prefer simple stories with durable growth; PEG ≈ reasonable; hunt “tenbaggers.”
5. **Philip Fisher** — *Scuttlebutt + quality growth*: assess management, innovation runway, and 15 qualitative points; concentrate and hold long.
6. **John Templeton** — *Maximum pessimism*: buy globally where fear is highest and valuations cheapest; be broadly diversified.
7. **Seth Klarman** — *Risk-first value*: absolute-return mindset, wide margin of safety, catalysts when possible, readiness to hold cash.
8. **Howard Marks** — *Second-level thinking* and cycle awareness; focus on risk control, credit discipline, and patient opportunism.
9. **Joel Greenblatt** — *Magic Formula*: buy high return on capital + high earnings-yield stocks; sprinkle in special situations/spinoffs.
10. **Ray Dalio** — *Economic machine + diversification*: balance uncorrelated bets (risk parity/All Weather); systematic rules and radical transparency.
11. **George Soros** — *Reflexivity*: macro trends can feed on themselves; size up when right, cut fast when wrong.
12. **Paul Tudor Jones** — *Trade trends, protect capital*: asymmetric risk/reward (e.g., \~5:1), strict stops, defense over offense.
13. **William O’Neil** — *CAN SLIM*: accelerating earnings/sales + industry leaders breaking out; cut losses quickly (\~7–8%).
14. **Jesse Livermore** — *The trend is your friend*: wait for confirmation, pyramid into strength, cut losses, avoid overtrading.
15. **Walter Schloss** — *Simple, deep value at scale*: buy lots of statistically cheap stocks; minimal meetings; extreme patience.
16. **David Dreman** — *Contrarian value*: buy out-of-favor low P/E, low P/B, high-yield names; expect mean reversion; avoid herd.
17. **T. Rowe Price Jr.** — *Growth at a reasonable price*: secular winners with strong management; ride long cycles but trim excesses.
18. **John Neff** — *Low P/E workhorses*: steady EPS growth + dividends; contrarian entry, patience on rerating.
19. **Thomas Russo** — *Capacity to suffer*: owner-operators who can reinvest heavily (esp. global consumer brands) for long-term dominance.
20. **Chuck Akre** — *Three-legged stool*: extraordinary business, extraordinary people, and extraordinary reinvestment—let compounding work.
21. **Nick Sleep** — *Scale economies shared*: firms that get cheaper to run as they grow and *pass savings to customers* to widen the moat.

Want this as a printable one-page cheat sheet or a quick screening checklist (with a couple of example metrics per framework)? I can whip that up.
