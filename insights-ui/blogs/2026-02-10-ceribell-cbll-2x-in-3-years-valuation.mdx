title: 'Can CeriBell (CBLL) Stock Double in 3 Years? A 3-Anchor Valuation Breakdown'
abstract: 'This article evaluates whether CeriBell (CBLL) can realistically deliver ~2× returns over the next three years using three non-overlapping anchors: Price-to-Sales, Price-to-Gross-Profit, and Price-to-Software Subscription Revenue. It breaks each anchor into fundamentals growth, valuation change, and per-share effects (dilution/cash burn) to show what must go right—and what is most likely instead.'

## 0) Big picture: what makes 2× hard or easy for CBLL

CeriBell is in a “real problem, urgent setting” niche: rapid seizure detection in ED/ICU workflows, where speed and ease-of-use matter, and the razor-and-blade model (device placements → recurring headbands + software subscriptions) can create sticky, high-margin revenue. The market direction should be favorable because hospitals keep pushing for faster point-of-care diagnostics and workflow efficiency, but adoption still depends on long hospital sales cycles and protocol change. Investor interest is usually strongest when growth stays high _and_ there is visible operating leverage; right now CBLL is still deeply loss-making despite very high gross margin. The single biggest reason 2× is hard is that the stock is already priced like an early-stage winner on sales while operating losses and cash burn remain large, so any growth slowdown or delayed path to breakeven can cause multiple compression before the fundamentals “earn” the valuation.

## 1) PRIMARY anchor: Price-to-Sales (P/S)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

P/S is the best primary anchor for CBLL because earnings and FCF are negative, while revenue growth is the cleanest observable “scoreboard” for hospital adoption and installed-base expansion. Using FY 2024 revenue of ~$65.4M and the current price of **$21.17**, CBLL is roughly at **~11–12× P/S** on FY 2024 sales (this is approximate because FY 2025 revenue is not provided and is likely higher, which would make the “current” P/S lower). For context inside CBLL’s own short public history, the FY 2024 snapshot implied a meaningfully higher P/S at a higher share price, so some derating has already happened.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× return in 3 years requires about **~26% per year**. In plain terms for a P/S-driven stock, you only get to 2× if revenue per share rises fast enough and the market does not punish the stock with a lower sales multiple while you get there.

Under this anchor, “2× in 3 years” typically needs some mix of: revenue roughly doubling, the P/S multiple holding roughly flat (or falling only a little), and dilution staying modest. For example, if revenue becomes ~2.2× larger over 3 years (about ~30% growth per year), and the P/S multiple slips modestly (say ~10–15% lower), and shares rise modestly (say ~5–10% more shares), you can still land near ~2×. If revenue is only ~1.6–1.8×, then 2× usually requires the valuation multiple to expand—which is much harder when losses are still large.

Based on company history, the most relevant “reality checks” for the next 3 years are: revenue growth has been very high off a small base (FY 2023 to FY 2024 was ~45% growth, and the year before that was even faster), but it is normal for growth to slow as the base gets bigger and as the company saturates early adopter sites. A realistic path is still strong growth, but more often **~20% to ~30% per year** than “forever 40%+.” Gross margin has been consistently very high (low-to-mid 80s to high 80s), so the constraint is not product margin; the constraint is scaling SG&A and reducing operating losses. If operating losses remain very large, the market can de-rate the sales multiple even if revenue keeps rising.

Compared to what 2× requires, the most likely gap is valuation behavior: the company can plausibly grow revenue strongly, but it must also show visible operating leverage to keep a double-digit P/S multiple from compressing. Net: fundamentals ~1.7× to ~2.2×; valuation ~0.75× to ~0.95×; per-share ~0.90× to ~0.97×; total ~1.15× to ~2.02×. **2× needs growth near the top end of that band, plus only mild multiple compression, plus limited dilution.**

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A realistic base case is that revenue grows around **~25% per year**, which is about **~1.95× over 3 years**. That assumes the “razor-and-blade” flywheel continues (more placements → more headbands + software usage), but growth naturally slows versus the earliest years. For valuation, a reasonable assumption is mild compression as the market keeps demanding progress on losses: for example **P/S drifting from ~11–12× to ~10×** over 3 years (about **~0.85× to ~0.90×** from today’s level). For per-share effects, CBLL had heavy share issuance in FY 2024, but with substantial cash on the balance sheet, the next 3 years _could_ have only modest dilution; a conservative assumption is **~5% to ~12% more shares** over 3 years, which is **~0.89× to ~0.95×** as a per-share multiplier.

Putting those together gives a base-case multiplier around **~1.55×** (roughly ~1.95× fundamentals × ~0.87× valuation × ~0.93× per-share). That implies an estimated 3-year price of **~$32.81** from the current price of **$21.17**. A defensible range for this anchor is **~1.25× to ~2.05×**, which translates to **~$26.46 to ~$43.40**, mainly driven by whether revenue stays closer to ~30% growth and whether the P/S multiple compresses modestly or heavily.

## 2) CROSS-CHECK anchor #1: Price-to-Gross-Profit (P/GP)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

P/GP is a useful cross-check because CBLL’s gross margin is exceptionally high (mid-80%+), so gross profit is closer to the company’s long-term economic potential than revenue alone. It also forces the right question: not “can they sell more?” but “can high gross profit eventually cover operating costs?” Using FY 2024 gross profit of ~$56.8M and the current price-derived market value (approximate), CBLL is roughly around the **low-teens multiple of gross profit** today. This anchor is still growth-sensitive, but it explicitly embeds the margin advantage and shifts the debate toward operating leverage.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× return in 3 years still means about **~26% per year**, but the “proof” demanded by the market is different here: the market needs to believe gross profit growth will _translate into narrowing losses_, not just “more top line.” In FY 2024, gross profit was far below operating expenses, so the company is not yet in the zone where incremental gross profit automatically becomes earnings.

For 2× under this anchor, you generally need gross profit to roughly double (or more) _and_ you need investors to keep paying a healthy multiple of that gross profit. If gross profit rises but operating expenses rise almost as fast, investors often compress the P/GP multiple because the business still looks like “high margin, but not scaling.” The easiest path to 2× is gross profit compounding strongly while operating expense growth clearly slows, making breakeven feel reachable.

Historically, the most likely “driver set” is: gross margin stays very high and relatively stable, so **gross profit growth mostly mirrors revenue growth**; the big variable is SG&A efficiency. In FY 2024, operating expenses were very large relative to revenue, implying a heavy go-to-market build-out. A realistic 3-year path is gross profit rising meaningfully (for example **~1.7× to ~2.2×**), while operating expense growth slows but does not freeze, improving EBIT margins from “very negative” to “less negative,” rather than flipping to strong profitability in just 3 years.

The gap versus 2× is that the valuation multiple on gross profit usually doesn’t expand unless operating leverage becomes obvious. Net: fundamentals ~1.7× to ~2.2×; valuation ~0.80× to ~1.00×; per-share ~0.90× to ~0.97×; total ~1.22× to ~2.13×. **2× needs strong gross profit growth plus clear operating leverage so the market doesn’t haircut the multiple.**

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A base case consistent with CBLL’s history is gross profit growing about **~25% per year** (again **~1.95× over 3 years**) because gross margin is already high and likely stays high. The valuation piece is where this anchor differs: if operating leverage is only gradual, it is reasonable to assume the market pays a bit less per dollar of gross profit over time—say **a move from low-teens P/GP to slightly lower** (roughly **~0.85× to ~0.90×**). For per-share effects, using the same conservative dilution assumption as before (because the company has cash but still burns cash), **~0.89× to ~0.95×** is a realistic per-share multiplier.

That yields a base-case outcome again near **~1.55×**, implying an estimated 3-year price of **~$32.81** from **$21.17**. A defensible range under this anchor is **~1.25× to ~2.00×**, translating to **~$26.46 to ~$42.34**, where the upside case mainly comes from operating expenses scaling slower than gross profit (allowing the P/GP multiple to hold), and the downside case comes from “growth continues but losses don’t narrow,” which tends to compress the multiple.

## 3) CROSS-CHECK anchor #2: Price-to-Software Subscription Revenue (Portal + Clarity)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

This anchor isolates the “blade” that can become the most durable and highest-quality stream over time: the subscription revenue from the EEG Portal and Clarity. It is a different lens from total revenue and gross profit because it focuses on recurring software economics and mix shift. FY 2024 software subscription revenue is given as **~$15.4M** (about **~24%** of total revenue), and at the current market value implied by the current price, the stock is effectively valued at a **very high multiple of current software subscription revenue** (because the software base is still small). This anchor asks a simple question: can software become big enough, fast enough, to justify meaningfully higher equity value even if hardware/consumables normalize?

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× return in 3 years (about **~26% per year**) under this lens usually requires software subscription revenue to compound much faster than total revenue _and_ for the market not to massively compress the multiple as the software line scales. If the market already “prices in” software becoming a much larger portion of the business, then software can grow strongly and the stock can still disappoint if the valuation multiple compresses.

For 2× here, the cleanest path is a mix shift story: software subscription revenue growing around **~2.5× to ~3.4×** over 3 years (which corresponds to roughly **~35% to ~50% growth per year**), while the “multiple of software” compresses only moderately as the base grows. The per-share effects still matter: if the company funds growth with equity, software growth per share is lower than software growth in dollars.

What is most likely, given the business model mechanics, is that software grows at least in line with the installed base and may grow faster if attach rates improve (more sites turning on the portal, more neurologists relying on it, broader protocol adoption). However, because the software revenue base is currently small, even strong growth might not be enough to keep today’s implied “software multiple” from compressing; investors tend to compress segment multiples as they become less “option-like” and more “measured.”

The gap versus 2× is that you need both a high software growth rate and a restrained derating. Net: fundamentals ~2.0× to ~3.4×; valuation ~0.60× to ~0.80×; per-share ~0.90× to ~0.97×; total ~1.08× to ~2.64×. **2× needs software growth near the high end plus only moderate multiple compression plus limited dilution.**

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A realistic base case (explicitly an assumption, because segment history is not provided) is software subscription revenue growing around **~40% per year**, which is about **~2.74× over 3 years**, driven by continued site adoption and improving attachment to the portal/Clarity workflow. On valuation, because today’s implied “software multiple” is very high (software is still a small base but carries big expectations), a conservative expectation is meaningful compression—say the effective multiple paid per dollar of software subscription revenue falling by **~25% to ~40%** over 3 years (roughly **~0.60× to ~0.75×**). For per-share effects, using the same dilution band of **~0.89× to ~0.95×** keeps the analysis grounded in financing reality.

In that base case, a reasonable point estimate is about **~1.80×** (roughly ~2.74× fundamentals × ~0.70× valuation × ~0.93× per-share). That implies an estimated 3-year price of **~$38.11** from **$21.17**. A defensible range for this anchor is **~1.35× to ~2.25×**, translating to **~$28.58 to ~$47.63**, with the swing factor being whether software truly accelerates into a much larger share of the business without triggering heavy multiple compression.

## 4) Final conclusion: most likely 3-year multiplier and the 2× verdict

Triangulating the three anchors, the most likely outcome is that CBLL delivers a solid but not automatic compounding profile: strong top-line growth, improving (but still negative) profitability, and a valuation that is more likely to compress modestly than expand meaningfully unless operating leverage becomes obvious. Across the anchors, a tight “most likely” band is **~1.3× to ~1.9×**, with a midpoint around **~1.6×**, coming from fundamentals roughly **~1.9× to ~2.3×**, valuation roughly **~0.8× to ~1.0×**, and per-share effects roughly **~0.9× to ~0.95×**. The **2× verdict is: Borderline**—achievable only if revenue (and especially software subscription revenue) stays in a high-growth regime _and_ the company demonstrates clear operating leverage so multiples don’t compress, while dilution remains modest. Using the **current price of $21.17**, the midpoint implies **~$33.87** in 3 years, and the most likely range implies **~$27.52 to ~$40.22**; in plain English: **“~1.6× ≈ ~$34, with a likely band of ~$28 to ~$40 from today’s ~$21.”**
