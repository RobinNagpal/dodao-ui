title: 'Can STERIS Stock Double in 3 Years? A 3-Anchor Valuation Breakdown (STE)'
abstract: 'This article checks whether STERIS (STE) can realistically deliver 2× returns over the next three years using three non-overlapping valuation anchors: EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, and EV/FCF. It breaks the outcome into fundamentals growth, valuation change, and per-share effects, and explains why 2× is more unlikely than it looks for a defensive healthcare compounder.'

## 0) Overall analysis

STERIS operates in infection prevention and sterile workflows, which is a “must-have” category tied to surgical volumes, regulatory compliance, and healthcare quality standards, so the underlying market direction is steady-to-growing rather than boom/bust. Investor interest in this kind of business is usually “quality compounder” interest, not hype, and that matters because the stock’s valuation already reflects durability and recurring revenue. The company’s trajectory looks like a stable compounder: revenue has grown, EBITDA margins have stayed in the mid-20s, and leverage has come down meaningfully, which is exactly what the market pays up for. The problem for a 2× target is that “defensive + already premium” rarely doubles quickly unless fundamentals accelerate well above the firm’s normal range or the market rerates to an unusually high multiple. Recent stock-return-style signals in the provided snapshot are not showing a pattern of sustained high annual returns, which is consistent with “good business, not a fast double.” The single biggest reason 2× is hard here is simple: at today’s price, you’re already paying a high multiple for steady growth, so there isn’t much room for multiple expansion to do the heavy lifting.

Shares outstanding trend (FY21–FY25): ~85M → ~98M → ~100M → ~99M → ~99M.

## 1) PRIMARY framework / anchor: EV/EBITDA

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/EBITDA is the best primary anchor for STERIS because the business is a mix of equipment, consumables, and service/outsourced sterilization where cash generation and operating leverage matter, and because leverage has been changing (deleveraging boosts equity value in a way EV-based metrics capture cleanly). Using FY 2025 EBITDA of about $1.46B and scaling the FY 2025 enterprise value to the current price, the stock is roughly at ~18× EV/EBITDA today (approximate). Historically in the provided data, EV/EBITDA has lived in a wide band (high-teens in FY23–FY25, much higher in FY21–FY22), and for a defensive healthcare workflow compounder the market usually doesn’t re-rate upward aggressively unless growth steps up.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× price move in 3 years requires roughly ~26% per year. For a company like STERIS, that kind of return usually must come mostly from per-share EBITDA or EPS compounding far above normal, because multiple expansion from an already-premium starting point is hard to sustain.

Under EV/EBITDA, the 2× math needs some combination of: EBITDA per share rising a lot, the EV/EBITDA multiple rising, and (to a smaller extent) share count shrinking and net debt falling. If EBITDA grew about ~10% per year (about ~1.33× over 3 years) and the multiple stayed around ~18×, you would not be close to 2× even with modest buybacks; you’d be closer to the low-to-mid 1.3× range. To get to 2× without major buybacks, you would need either mid-teens EBITDA growth (closer to ~1.5× over 3 years) plus meaningful multiple expansion, or you would need the multiple to jump to levels that look high versus STERIS’s more “normal” recent trading range.

The most likely fundamentals path, based on company history, looks like mid-single-digit to high-single-digit revenue growth and relatively stable EBITDA margins. FY23–FY25 revenue growth has been roughly mid-single to low-teens (with FY22 being an outlier step-up year), and EBITDA margin has stayed around the mid-20s (roughly ~26–27% in the provided data). A reasonable, grounded range is revenue up ~5–8% per year, EBITDA margin roughly flat to modestly up (call it +0 to +100 bps over three years), and continued balance-sheet normalization (debt/EBITDA already improved a lot by FY25, so the “easy” deleveraging is mostly behind you). That combination points to EBITDA growth more like ~7–10% per year, not ~15–20% per year.

When you compare required vs likely, the gap is mainly the growth rate. A likely EBITDA outcome of ~1.23× to ~1.33× over three years does not naturally produce 2× from an ~18× starting multiple. Net: fundamentals ~1.23× to ~1.33×; valuation ~0.90× to ~1.10×; per-share ~1.00× to ~1.04×; total ~1.11× to ~1.52×. 2× needs sustained mid-teens EBITDA growth and/or a rerating toward the high-20s EV/EBITDA, which is above this stock’s “defensive compounder” reality.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A realistic base case is that STERIS keeps compounding steadily: revenue grows around ~6–7% per year as hospital procedure volumes and compliance spending rise gradually, AST volumes and pricing normalize, and life sciences demand stays mid-single-digit. With EBITDA margins already around the mid-20s, a big margin expansion is not the base case; modest efficiency gains might add a little, but mix shifts and labor/service costs can offset that. Putting that together, EBITDA growing around ~8% per year is reasonable, which is about ~1.26× over three years.

On valuation, starting at roughly ~18× EV/EBITDA already embeds “high quality, recurring revenue, low drama.” In a steady scenario, a flat multiple is the cleanest assumption; a mild derate is plausible if rates stay higher or if healthcare capital spending slows, and a mild rerate is plausible if growth surprises to the upside. A sensible three-year valuation multiplier is ~0.95× to ~1.05× (roughly “mid-teens to around 19×” rather than a dramatic shift). On per-share effects, the share count has been roughly flat recently, and net debt has come down a lot already; over the next three years, a modest tailwind from small buybacks plus incremental debt reduction might be worth ~1.01× to ~1.03× on price.

That gives a base-case price multiplier of about ~1.30× (about ~1.26× fundamentals times ~1.00× valuation times ~1.02× per-share). A defensible range under this anchor is ~1.15× to ~1.55×, and it is intentionally not huge because this is a defensive, recurring-revenue business with relatively stable margins. Using the current price of $246.91 (as of February 10, 2026), the base-case implied 3-year price is about ~$321, with a 3-year price range of roughly ~$284 to ~$383.

## 2) CROSS-CHECK framework / anchor #1: EV/Sales

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/Sales is a useful cross-check here because STERIS has a large recurring revenue base (consumables, service, and outsourced sterilization), and in stable healthcare “workflow” businesses the market often prices the stock off a revenue multiple that quietly embeds expectations for gross margin, mix, and durability. Using FY 2025 revenue of about $5.46B and scaling FY 2025 enterprise value to the current price, the stock is roughly at ~4.9× EV/Sales today (approximate). In the provided history, EV/Sales has moved from much higher levels in FY21–FY22 down toward the mid-4× area in FY23–FY25, consistent with normalization after a higher-multiple period.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× outcome over three years still means ~26% per year, and under EV/Sales the hurdle is stark: if the EV/Sales multiple stays flat, enterprise value must roughly double, which would imply revenue roughly doubling. That is not realistic for a company growing in the mid-single digits in a mature, regulated healthcare spend category.

So to make 2× happen under this anchor, you’d need two things at once: revenue growth much higher than history suggests, and/or the EV/Sales multiple expanding materially above its recent band. A “double” without revenue doubling requires the market to pay a far richer revenue multiple than today, which generally only happens if the company proves it can sustain faster growth or structurally higher profitability than previously believed.

The likely fundamentals path, based on company history and business mechanics, is steady growth rather than hypergrowth. Hospitals do not replace sterile processing equipment every year, and capital budgets can be delayed; that caps how fast the installed base can expand. Recurring consumables and service are sticky and resilient, but they tend to grow with procedures and installed base, not explode. A grounded range is revenue up ~5–8% per year, supported by stable demand and pricing, with the risk that hospital capital deferrals make the low end more relevant in a slow macro year.

Comparing required vs likely makes 2× look even harder under this lens. Net: fundamentals (revenue) ~1.16× to ~1.26×; valuation (EV/Sales) ~0.90× to ~1.10×; per-share ~1.00× to ~1.03×; total ~1.04× to ~1.43×. 2× needs either revenue growth far above the company’s demonstrated pace or a major EV/Sales rerating that usually does not happen for mature healthcare workflow businesses.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A reasonable base case is revenue compounding around ~6% per year, or about ~1.19× over three years. The upside case is closer to ~8% per year (~1.26×) if procedure volumes, price, and AST demand all cooperate at the same time; the downside case is closer to ~5% (~1.16×) if hospital capital spending is cautious and growth leans more on recurring service rather than new equipment placements.

For valuation, the EV/Sales multiple at roughly ~4.9× already assumes a durable franchise. If growth stays mid-single-digit and margins stay “good but not structurally resetting higher,” there is a real chance the multiple is flat-to-down rather than up. A practical valuation multiplier is ~0.95× to ~1.05×, with the upper end requiring the market to treat STERIS as a slightly faster compounder than it has looked in the last few years. Per-share effects are small here as well; assume roughly ~1.01×.

That implies a base-case multiplier around ~1.20× to ~1.30×, with a defensible range of ~1.10× to ~1.45× under the EV/Sales lens. Using $246.91 today, that maps to a base-case implied 3-year price around ~$308 to ~$321, and a 3-year price range of roughly ~$272 to ~$358.

## 3) CROSS-CHECK framework / anchor #2: EV/FCF (FCF yield)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/FCF is the cleanest “owner earnings” cross-check because STERIS’s long-term equity outcome should ultimately track free cash flow per share and what multiple the market is willing to pay for it. Using FY 2025 free cash flow of about $0.78B and scaling enterprise value to the current price, the stock is roughly at ~34–35× EV/FCF today (approximate), which corresponds to a low-3% FCF yield. In other words, the market is pricing STERIS like a reliable cash compounder, not a bargain where multiple expansion is likely to be the main return driver.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× price outcome in three years implies ~26% per year, and with a low-3% FCF yield, the math is demanding. If the EV/FCF multiple stays flat, you essentially need FCF to nearly double over three years to double the stock, which would require something like mid-20% annual FCF growth. That is not consistent with a mature healthcare workflow business that already has decent margins and meaningful reinvestment needs.

To make 2× happen under this anchor, you need either (1) unusually strong FCF growth from a mix of higher revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong cash conversion, and/or (2) the market paying an even higher EV/FCF multiple than the mid-30s level today. But when a stock already trades at a low-3% FCF yield, further rerating is typically limited unless the growth outlook steps up in a lasting way.

Looking at likely fundamentals, STERIS has produced meaningful FCF, but the conversion has moved around because of working capital, capex, and deal activity. FY25 FCF margin was strong (mid-teens), but prior years were lower (high-single digits to low-teens). A grounded three-year path is FCF growing roughly in line with EBITDA, say ~7–11% per year, helped by steady margins and some working-capital normalization, but offset by capex and ongoing investment. That gets you to something like ~1.23× to ~1.37× FCF growth over three years, not ~2×.

The required vs likely gap is again mostly growth, plus the fact that high starting valuation makes rerating harder. Net: fundamentals (FCF) ~1.23× to ~1.37×; valuation (EV/FCF) ~0.90× to ~1.05×; per-share ~1.00× to ~1.04×; total ~1.11× to ~1.50×. 2× needs a structural step-up in cash generation that is well above the company’s recent range, plus either heavy buybacks or a higher multiple than a mid-30s EV/FCF starting point.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A realistic base case is FCF per share compounding around ~9% per year, which is about ~1.30× over three years, driven by steady revenue growth and stable margins rather than a dramatic efficiency wave. The low end is ~7% per year (~1.23×) if working capital and reinvestment are less favorable; the high end is ~11% (~1.37×) if cash conversion remains near FY25 levels and growth is solid.

On valuation, a mid-30s EV/FCF multiple is already “expensive but justified by stability.” If rates remain higher or growth is merely mid-single-digit, a modest multiple compression is plausible; if growth surprises up and the market wants defensives, a small rerate is plausible. A practical valuation multiplier is ~0.95× base, with a range of ~0.90× to ~1.03×. Per-share effects should be modest; assume ~1.02× as a middle-of-the-road mix of small buybacks and incremental debt reduction.

That yields a base-case price multiplier around ~1.25× (about ~1.30× fundamentals times ~0.95× valuation times ~1.02× per-share). A defensible range is ~1.10× to ~1.50×. Using $246.91 today, that implies a base-case 3-year price around ~$309, with a 3-year price range of roughly ~$272 to ~$370.

## 4) Final conclusion

Across EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, and EV/FCF, the common message is that STERIS looks like a high-quality, defensive compounder with steady fundamentals, but the current valuation already prices in that quality, which limits the odds of a fast double. Triangulating the three anchors, the most likely 3-year multiplier is ~1.40× with a tight range of ~1.25× to ~1.55×; the decomposition is roughly fundamentals ~1.22× to ~1.35×, valuation ~0.90× to ~1.10×, and per-share ~1.00× to ~1.04×. The 2× verdict is Unlikely because it would require sustained mid-teens fundamentals growth and/or a major rerating to unusually high multiples for a mature healthcare workflow business. The single swing factor that would most likely change the answer is a proven, durable step-up to mid-teens EBITDA and FCF growth (not a one-year spike) that convinces the market STERIS is structurally faster-growing than its recent history. Current price is $246.91 (February 10, 2026), which implies a midpoint 3-year price near ~$346 and a 3-year price range of roughly ~$309 to ~$383; in plain English, ~1.40× maps to about $346, while ~1.25× to ~1.55× maps to about $309 to $383.
