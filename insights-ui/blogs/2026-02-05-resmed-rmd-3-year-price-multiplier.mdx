This report analyzes the 3-year investment horizon for ResMed Inc. (RMD) to determine the likelihood of a 2.0× stock price multiplier based on fundamental drivers and valuation anchors.

## **A) Anchor selection**

The primary value anchor for ResMed is the Forward P/E ratio. As a mature, consistently profitable medical technology leader with a dominant market share in sleep-disordered breathing, ResMed is primarily valued by institutional investors on its ability to grow per-share earnings. The company’s business model—selling long-lived hardware (CPAP machines) that pulls through high-margin, recurring consumables (masks)—provides the earnings visibility that makes P/E an effective tool for capturing the company’s "growth at a reasonable price" (GARP) profile. Other anchors like Price-to-Book are less suitable because ResMed’s value is tied to intangible intellectual property and distribution relationships rather than physical assets.

The first cross-check anchor is Price-to-Free Cash Flow (P/FCF). While earnings show accounting profitability, P/FCF captures ResMed’s actual cash generation capability, which is vital for a company that must balance heavy R&D and inventory management with capital returns. This anchor is more informative than P/E when the company experiences large swings in working capital or tax rates, as seen in recent years. It specifically captures the efficiency of the "consumables" side of the business, where the cash cycle is faster and more predictable than the initial device sale.

The second cross-check anchor is EV/EBITDA. This anchor is necessary to catch blind spots related to the company’s capital structure and leverage. Over the last five years, ResMed has fluctuated between a net debt position of $1.35 billion to its current net cash position of approximately $357 million. By using Enterprise Value, we account for the fact that ResMed has been using its cash flow to de-lever and build a cash cushion, which adds value to the equity holder that might be missed by simple price-based ratios. It also provides a cleaner look at operating performance by stripping out the non-cash depreciation of its manufacturing facilities.

## **B) The 3–4 driver framework**

The first and most critical driver is Revenue Growth. ResMed’s top line is fueled by the underlying prevalence of sleep apnea and the company’s ability to capture share from competitors like Philips. Historically, revenue has grown from $3.20 billion in FY21 to $5.15 billion in FY25, representing a compound growth rate of roughly 12.6% per year. In our 3-year outlook, a sustained 10% annual revenue growth would lead to a ~1.33× multiplier on the top line. This driver directly impacts all three anchors by expanding the denominator of the valuation ratios.

The second driver is Operating Margin expansion. ResMed has shown significant operating leverage, moving from a 28.7% EBIT margin in FY21 to 32.8% in FY25. This improvement stems from the mix shift toward higher-margin masks and digital software, alongside the normalization of supply chain costs that spiked during the pandemic. For the anchors, every 1% of margin expansion acts as a multiplier on top of revenue growth, allowing earnings and EBITDA to grow faster than sales.

The third driver is Free Cash Flow (FCF) Conversion. ResMed’s ability to turn accounting profits into spendable cash is tied to its inventory management and the growth of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) business. FCF has been volatile, dipping to $216 million in FY22 during supply chain snarls before rebounding to $1.66 billion in FY25. If ResMed maintains its current FCF margin of ~32%, it can fund dividends and buybacks without taking on new debt. This impacts the P/FCF anchor and determines the pace at which the "Equity Value" portion of EV increases.

The fourth driver is Share Count Reduction. While ResMed has historically focused on organic growth and debt repayment, its move into a net cash position ($1.21 billion in cash vs. $852 million in debt) allows for more aggressive share repurchases. In FY25, the company reduced its share count slightly, but a more formal buyback program could reduce the denominator by 1% to 2% annually. Because all anchors are ultimately viewed on a per-share or per-equity-unit basis, reducing the share count by ~5% over three years would provide a ~1.05× tailwind to the stock price regardless of business growth.

## **C) Baseline snapshot**

ResMed’s current baseline (FY2025) reflects a business at peak operational efficiency. Revenue stands at $5.15 billion, generating a gross margin of 60.0% and an EBIT (operating income) of $1.69 billion. The company currently earns $9.55 per share (EPS) and generates $11.28 in free cash flow per share. With total debt of $852 million and cash of $1.21 billion, the company is in a net cash position of $358 million, providing a clean balance sheet for future reinvestment or capital returns.

Looking at the 5-year trend, ResMed has demonstrated remarkable consistency and scaling capability. Revenue has grown every year since 2021, moving from $3.2 billion to over $5.1 billion, a 60% total increase. More importantly, net income has nearly tripled from $474 million to $1.40 billion over the same period, indicating massive operating leverage as the company matured its digital health platforms. The free cash flow margin has also improved from under 20% to over 32% as the company moved past the capital-intensive "restock" phase necessitated by competitor recalls.

## **D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”**

To achieve a 2.0× multiplier in 3 years, ResMed’s stock would need to rise from 257 to 514. This requires an annualized total return of approximately 26%. In a market regime similar to today’s, where the P/E multiple remains around 23x–26x, ResMed would need to double its per-share earnings from $9.55 to roughly $19.10 by year three. This would imply an earnings growth rate of 26% per year, which is significantly higher than the company's long-term historical average of ~15%.

For the P/E anchor to support a 2.0× return, ResMed would need either a "step-change" in earnings growth or a massive expansion of the multiple. If earnings grow at a healthy 12% per year (~1.40× over 3 years), the P/E multiple would have to expand from the current 23x forward to 33x to hit the 2.0× target. For the FCF anchor, a 2.0× return would require FCF per share to reach ~$22.50. Given the current 32% FCF margin, this would require revenue to grow to nearly $10 billion, which is nearly double current levels and highly improbable in a 3-year window.

Based on company history, the most likely path is more conservative. ResMed typically grows revenue in the 8% to 12% range. If we assume 10% revenue growth and stable 32% operating margins, net income would likely grow at roughly 11% to 13% per year. This suggests a per-share earnings range of $12.75 to $13.50 in three years. This level of fundamental growth (~1.4x total) is consistent with ResMed’s execution capacity and the steady expansion of the sleep apnea market.

Industry logic suggests that while ResMed is the leader, it faces two headwinds to "2.0× growth." First, the reentry of Philips into the market will naturally cap ResMed’s market share gains, making the 30% growth seen in recent years an outlier. Second, the rise of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs has created a narrative headwind; even if GLP-1s ultimately increase CPAP adherence (as ResMed argues), the market is unlikely to award the stock a 33x P/E multiple while this uncertainty persists. Therefore, fundamentals are more likely to track the historical 10–12% growth rate than a 26% "doubling" rate.

The gap between the "required" 26% growth and the "likely" 12% growth is approximately 14% per year. For each anchor, this gap can only be closed by a major re-rating of the stock's valuation, which is unlikely given that ResMed is already trading at a premium to the broader medical device sector. Net: fundamentals imply a ~1.4× to ~1.6× multiplier; 2.0× requires a return to hyper-growth or a multiple expansion to 33x+ that is above history and the current business reality.

## **E) Business reality check**

To hit the base-case driver of 10% revenue growth, ResMed must focus on "patient identification" and "consumable pull-through." Operationally, this means expanding its digital footprint so that existing patients are prompted to replace masks and tubes every 90 days. Since masks have higher margins than the devices themselves, increasing the "attachment rate" is the primary way ResMed can grow earnings faster than revenue without needing a breakthrough in new technology.

The primary constraint on this path is the return of competition. If Philips successfully cleans up its regulatory standing and resumes aggressive sales, ResMed’s pricing power on devices could be squeezed. Furthermore, if the Residential Care Software segment (Brightree/MatrixCare) faces slower adoption in the post-acute space due to labor shortages at nursing facilities, it would act as a drag on the high-margin portion of the business. These factors would likely cap revenue growth in the high single digits, making the 2.0× hurdle even more difficult to clear.

Reconciling the numbers with business logic, a 2.0× multiplier is not plausible under current conditions. The operational changes required to double earnings in 3 years would require ResMed to essentially monopolize the global sleep market while simultaneously doubling the price or frequency of mask replacements. While ResMed is an exceptional business with high switching costs and a strong data moat, its path is one of steady, incremental compounding rather than explosive, "step-change" growth.

## **F) Multi-anchor triangulation**

### **1. Primary anchor: Forward P/E**

The baseline for this anchor is a Forward P/E of 22.95x based on current market data and an EPS of $9.55 for FY2025. This multiple is roughly in line with ResMed’s 5-year average, reflecting a premium for its high margins and dominant market position but tempered by the long-term uncertainty regarding weight-loss drugs.

The 3-year driver inputs assume 10% annual revenue growth and a 32% operating margin. History shows that ResMed can leverage its SG&A costs as it scales, making it reasonable to expect EPS to grow at ~12% per year. This is grounded in the reality that the sleep apnea market is still largely under-diagnosed, providing a long runway for volume growth.

In plain-English math, 12% growth per year results in a ~1.40× multiplier (1.12 × 1.12 × 1.12) over three years. If the P/E multiple remains steady at 23x, the stock price would follow this ~1.40× path. The high end (1.55×) would require the P/E to expand toward 26x, while the low end (1.25×) would result from a multiple contraction to 20x if competition intensifies.

### **2. Cross-check anchor #1: P/FCF**

The baseline metric is a Price-to-Free Cash Flow of 22.73x based on FY2025 FCF of 1.66 billion (11.28 per share). This reflects a very healthy cash conversion rate where FCF actually exceeds net income, largely due to efficient inventory management following the post-pandemic recovery.

The 3-year driver inputs assume ResMed maintains an FCF margin of at least 30%. This is reasonable because the business is shifting toward recurring consumables and software, which are less capital-intensive than manufacturing new CPAP platforms. Industry peers in high-margin med-tech typically convert 80% to 100% of net income to FCF, and ResMed is currently performing at the top of this range.

Using plain-English math, growing the current $11.28 of FCF per share to $15.00 of FCF per share in year three is a ~1.33× multiplier:

$$
\frac{15.00}{11.28} \approx 1.33\times
$$

If the market continues to value this cash at 23x, the price multiplier matches the fundamental growth. The high end (~1.5×) would require FCF margins to expand to 35% through further software scaling.

### **3. Cross-check anchor #2: EV/EBITDA**

The baseline EV/EBITDA is 20.24x, with a trailing EBITDA of $1.86 billion and an enterprise value of approximately $37.66 billion. This anchor accounts for the company's shift into a net cash position, which reduces the Enterprise Value relative to the market cap.

The inputs for this anchor assume EBITDA grows in line with EBIT at ~11% per year, as depreciation remains stable for its existing manufacturing footprint. Business context suggests that as ResMed pays down its remaining $852 million in debt or builds its cash balance, the "Equity Value" portion of the company becomes a larger share of the total Enterprise Value.

In plain-English math, 11% EBITDA growth over 3 years yields a ~1.37× fundamental multiplier. When you add the effect of de-levering (reducing debt and increasing cash), the equity holder captures an additional 2–3% of value. This leads to a total estimated multiplier of ~1.40× to ~1.45×, assuming the EV/EBITDA multiple remains in its historical 18x–22x band.

## **G) Valuation sanity check**

Valuation is likely to be a neutral to slight headwind over the next three years. ResMed’s current Forward P/E of ~23x is near the middle of its historical range (which has swung from 18x to 35x during the Philips recall peak). Because the "Philips-is-gone" tailwind is now fully priced in, and the "GLP-1-fear" acts as a valuation ceiling, it is unlikely that we will see the multiple expand significantly from here. A reasonable historical band for a company with 10% growth and 30% margins is 20x to 25x.

This translates into a valuation multiplier range of 0.9× to 1.1×. If the multiple stays at 23x, the multiplier is 1.0× (neutral). If it drifts to 20x due to increased competition, it becomes a 0.87× headwind. If it moves to 26x because GLP-1 fears evaporate, it becomes a 1.13× tailwind. Given the stability of ResMed’s regime, the most likely outcome is a neutral 1.0×, meaning the stock price will likely track the ~1.4× fundamental growth almost exactly.

## **H) Final answer**

The most likely 3-year price multiplier range for ResMed is **1.4× to 1.6×**. This range is driven by a consistent 10–12% growth in per-share earnings and free cash flow, supported by a stable valuation multiple in the 22x–24x P/E range.

The bull-case multiplier range is **1.7× to 1.8×**, which would require revenue growth to accelerate to 15% through a complete failure of the Philips return and a major expansion of the Residential Care Software margins. This case also assumes the market grants ResMed a 28x multiple as it realizes that weight-loss drugs actually increase the total addressable market for sleep therapy by improving patient diagnosis rates.

Verdict: **Unlikely** for reaching 2.0× in 3 years.
