## A) Anchor Selection

The primary valuation anchor for Sigma Lithium is the **Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)** multiple. This metric is the standard for the mining industry because it normalizes for the heavy capital structures and varied depreciation schedules inherent in capital-intensive extractive businesses. Since Sigma is transitioning from a developer to a steady-state producer, EV/EBITDA allows us to value the business based on its operational cash-generating potential while accounting for its significant debt load of ~$176.75 million. Other common anchors, like the P/E ratio, are currently unsuitable because Sigma’s net income is heavily distorted by non-cash items—such as the $31.49 million currency exchange loss in FY2024—and the high D&A associated with the initial ramp-up of the Grota do Cirilo project.

The first cross-check anchor is **Price to Net Asset Value (P/NAV)**. In the mining sector, this is the most informative metric during the transition from Phase 1 to subsequent expansion phases. While EBITDA captures current production, P/NAV captures the total lifecycle value of the mineral reserves and resources across all three planned phases of the project. This anchor is essential because it accounts for the long-term depletion of the asset and the net present value of future production that current-year operating metrics may miss. It serves as a floor for valuation by focusing on the "sum of the parts" of the underlying lithium deposit in Minas Gerais.

The second cross-check anchor is **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield**. This metric captures the "liquidity and dilution" risk, which is the primary blind spot for a high-growth miner like Sigma. With a current cash balance of only ~65.52 million, the company’s ability to generate cash to fund Phase 2 expansion without further diluting shareholders is critical. FCF yield forces an assessment of capital intensity and interest burdens—Sigma paid ~$30.33 million in cash interest in FY2024—which EBITDA-based valuations often ignore.

## B) The 3–4 Driver Framework

The most critical driver for Sigma Lithium is **Production Volume Ramp-up**, specifically the successful transition from Phase 1 (~270,000 tonnes per annum) to the completion of Phase 2/3 expansion (targeting ~520,000+ tonnes). In mining, scale is the primary lever for revenue growth and unit cost reduction. Historically, Sigma was a non-revenue developer until 2023; the jump to $145.08 million in revenue for FY2024 demonstrates the impact of Phase 1. This driver directly impacts the EV/EBITDA anchor, as the fixed-cost nature of the Greentech processing plant means that every incremental tonne of concentrate produced carries a higher marginal profit.

The second driver is **Unit Cash Cost Realization**, which refers to Sigma's ability to maintain its position in the lowest quartile of the global cost curve. Management targets a spodumene cash cost of roughly $400 to $500 per tonne. In FY2024, the cost of revenue was $114.31 million against $145.08 million in revenue, implying a gross margin of ~21.21%, which is relatively thin for a low-cost claimant during a ramp-up phase. If Sigma can lower unit costs through operational efficiencies and higher throughput, it will significantly expand the EBITDA margin, which is the denominator for our primary anchor.

The third driver is **Lithium Price Realization (ASP)**, specifically for 5.5%–6.0% battery-grade spodumene. Since this is a pure-play commodity business, the top line is highly sensitive to the seaborne lithium market. While we assume a "similar environment" to today, we must acknowledge that Sigma’s high-purity concentrate often earns a premium or avoids the steep discounts applied to lower-quality ore. This driver impacts the P/NAV anchor, as the discount rate and long-term price assumptions used to calculate the value of the reserves determine the total equity upside.

The fourth driver is **Capital Structure and Share Dilution**. Sigma has a history of share count expansion, with shares outstanding increasing from ~72 million in 2020 to ~111 million in 2024. Given the current liquidity constraint (cash of $6.11M vs. current liabilities of $128.32M in Q3 2025), there is a high probability of a capital raise to fund further growth. This driver is the most significant headwind to per-share outcomes, as any growth in enterprise value must be shared across a potentially larger pool of stock, directly impacting the FCF per share and P/NAV cross-checks.

## C) Baseline Snapshot

As of the latest fiscal periods, Sigma Lithium is in a precarious but productive "early-growth" state. For FY2024, the company generated $145.08 million in revenue and managed a slim positive EBITDA of $8.88 million, representing a 6.12% margin. However, the most recent quarterly data from Q3 2025 shows revenue of $28.55 million with a negative EBITDA of $7.19 million, highlighting the volatility in early production stages and sensitivity to recent lithium price softness. The balance sheet remains strained, with total debt of $166.41 million against a cash position that has dwindled from $45.91 million at year-end 2024 to just $6.11 million in late 2025.

The 3-to-5-year trend reflects a company moving rapidly through the mining lifecycle, from zero revenue in 2022 to $137 million in 2023 and $145 million in 2024. While revenue growth has been massive, operating leverage has not yet materialized consistently; operating expenses fluctuated from $95 million in 2022 (pre-production) to $35 million in 2024. The share count trend is consistently upward, growing at a 5-year CAGR of roughly 11%. This trend implies that while the asset is world-class and production is scaling, the company has not yet reached the "self-funding" stage where operating leverage can overcome the interest burden and capital requirements.

## D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”

Achieving a 2.0x stock price multiplier in 3 years requires a ~26% annualized return. Translating this to per-share fundamentals, if the share count remains stable at 111 million, the market cap must rise from ~$3.84 billion. In an environment where the lithium price does not "moon," this doubling would require a massive expansion in FCF per share or a significant rerating of the multiple based on the successful derisking of Phase 2 and 3. Essentially, Sigma must transition from a "risky developer" to a "stable cash-cow" with roughly $300 million to $400 million in annual EBITDA to justify a $3.8 billion valuation.

For our anchors, a 2.0x move requires specific fundamental shifts. For EV/EBITDA, assuming a peer-average 10x multiple, Sigma would need to generate ~$370 million of EBITDA to justify a ~$3.7 billion enterprise value (vs. ~$8.9 million today). For P/NAV, the stock currently trades at a premium to its tangible book value ($83M vs. ~$1.92B market cap), so a doubling would require a major increase in the project NPV, which is difficult without higher long-term lithium price assumptions. For FCF yield, Sigma would need to generate ~$200 million in annual FCF to offer an attractive 5-6% yield on a $3.8 billion market cap.

Based on company history, the most likely fundamental path is one of continued but uneven growth. Over the next 3 years, it is likely that Sigma will successfully commission Phase 2, doubling production volume. However, history suggests this will come with at least 10–15% further dilution (~125M shares) to bridge the current liquidity gap. We expect EBITDA to improve as fixed costs are spread over more tonnes, likely reaching a range of $150 million to $200 million, assuming lithium prices remain in a similar regime (roughly $1,100-$1,300/t spodumene).

Industry logic suggests that while Sigma's "Green Lithium" branding is a differentiator, it is still a commodity producer subject to the global cost curve. While Sigma sits in the lower quartile, the competition in Australia is scaling faster. The likely range for unit costs will be ~$450 to ~$550/t. Given the "similar regime" constraint, the business model will likely achieve positive but not "explosive" cash flow, as the Brazilian interest rate environment and logistical bottlenecks in Minas Gerais provide a natural cap on operating margins compared to Australian peers with better infrastructure.

Net: Fundamentals imply a ~1.1x to ~1.4x multiplier; 2.0x requires a doubling of current lithium prices or a total elimination of operational risk discounts that are currently unrealistic. The gap between the "required" $370M EBITDA and the "likely" $200M EBITDA is too wide to bridge without a major macro tailwind.

## E) Business Reality Check

To reach even the base-case driver ranges, Sigma must achieve near-flawless operational execution at its Greentech plant. This means maintaining high recovery rates (the amount of lithium extracted from the ore) and minimizing the production of "off-spec" material. Operationally, the company wins if it can prove that its "Triple Zero" ESG process does not come at a hidden cost of lower recovery or higher reagent use. Success requires the Phase 2 expansion to be commissioned on time and under budget, which would allow the company to spread its corporate overhead across 500kt+ of volume.

The key constraints are financing and geological consistency. If the lithium price experiences another 20% leg down, Sigma’s current $6M cash balance becomes a critical failure mode, likely leading to a "down-round" equity raise or predatory debt terms that would break the FCF and P/NAV anchors. Furthermore, any logistical delay at the Port of Vitória or regulatory hurdles in Brazil could stall shipments. Because Sigma is a single-asset company, even a minor fire or labor strike at Grota do Cirilo would reduce revenue to zero, a risk that diversified peers like Pilbara Minerals do not face to the same degree.

Reconciling the business logic with the numbers, the path to a 2.0x multiplier appears implausible under conservative assumptions. The operational change required is a "step-change" rather than incremental; the company must essentially quintuple its cash flow from operations while simultaneously paying down debt and funding expansion. While the asset is high-quality, the financial starting point (high debt, low cash, commodity price sensitivity) creates a drag that makes a 100% return in 3 years a "bull-case only" scenario rather than a realistic base case.

## F) Multi-anchor Triangulation

### 1. Primary Anchor: EV/EBITDA

The baseline reference point is the FY2024 EBITDA of $8.88 million against an enterprise value of ~$2.15 billion. This yields a trailing EV/EBITDA that is mathematically high (>150x) and largely irrelevant for a ramping asset, as it reflects a business that has yet to reach its designed capacity.

For the 3-year outlook, we assume production scales to 500,000 tonnes at an ASP of $1,150/t, generating ~$575 million of revenue. Assuming a ~35% EBITDA margin, this implies EBITDA of ~$201 million. This margin is reasonable as it sits between current low margins and management’s highly optimistic targets, reflecting historical volatility in mining ramp-ups.

Applying a conservative 8x to 10x EV/EBITDA multiple (the peer range for mid-tier miners) results in a future EV of $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion. After subtracting ~$150 million in remaining net debt, the equity value is roughly $1.45 billion to $1.85 billion. Compared to the current $1.92 billion market cap, this suggests a **fundamental multiplier of 0.8x to 1.0x**. The low end is caused by sustained low lithium prices, while the high end assumes perfect Phase 2 execution.

### 2. Cross-check Anchor #1: P/NAV

The current baseline for Sigma is a market cap of $1.92 billion against a tangible book value of only $83.77 million (Q3 2025). The market is currently valuing the stock at a significant premium to its historical costs, pricing in the future value of the reserves.

For the 3-year estimate, we project a Net Asset Value (NAV) based on the 20-year mine life. Using a 10% discount rate (typical for Brazil) and a conservative long-term spodumene price of ~$1,100/t, the project NAV is estimated at ~$2.5 billion. Applying a 0.7x to 0.8x P/NAV ratio—standard for a single-asset producer in a developing economy—results in an equity value of $1.75 billion to $2.0 billion.

This results in a **fundamental multiplier of 0.9x to 1.1x**. The logic is that while the resource is large, the "regime" of the lithium market limits the NPV expansion. To hit a 2.0x multiplier here, the NPV would have to double, which would require either a massive resource expansion or a significant reduction in the discount rate (unlikely given Brazil's macro profile).

### 3. Cross-check Anchor #2: FCF Yield

The current baseline FCF is negative, with a -$35.91 million outflow in FY2024 and significant volatility in recent quarters. The company is currently "burning" cash to sustain operations and interest payments.

By Year 3, assuming Phase 2 is operational, we project Operating Cash Flow of ~$140 million, less ~$40 million for sustaining capex and ~$100 million for interest and growth capex, resulting in a near break-even to modestly positive FCF outcome. For a ~$3.84B market cap, the company would need to generate ~$230 million in FCF to maintain a standard 6% yield.

This implies a **fundamental multiplier of 0.7x to 1.2x**. The upside is capped by the heavy interest burden and the high maintenance requirements of a tropical mining operation. A landmine for this anchor is the high probability of share dilution; if share count grows 15%, the FCF per share drops accordingly, further distancing the stock from a 2.0x target.

## G) Valuation Sanity Check

Valuation is currently a neutral to slightly negative headwind. Sigma trades at a premium to many of its Australian peers on a Price-to-Book and EV-to-Sales basis because the market has "priced in" the success of Phase 2. For example, the current EV/Sales of ~11.2x is very high for a commodity producer; most mature miners trade between 2x and 4x. This suggests that the current stock price is not "cheap" and requires significant fundamental growth just to justify its current level, let alone double.

The conservative valuation multiplier range over 3 years is **0.8x to 1.1x**. This range is justified because as Sigma matures from a "growth story" to a "production story," its multiples will naturally compress toward industry norms. In a "similar regime" environment, there is no reason for the market to grant Sigma a "hype premium." Therefore, even if EBITDA grows, the multiple contraction will likely offset much of the fundamental gain.

---

## H) Final Answer

The most likely 3-year price multiplier range is **0.8x to 1.2x**. This base range reflects the reality that while production volumes will likely double, the current valuation already captures much of this expansion, and the combination of high interest costs, likely share dilution, and multiple compression will act as a significant ceiling on equity upside.

In a bull-case scenario, the multiplier could reach **1.5x to 1.7x**, but this requires Phase 2 to be completed ahead of schedule, the realization of a sustained "green premium" for its concentrate that keeps margins above 45%, and a strategic decision to refinance debt at significantly lower rates to stop FCF leakage. Even in this bull case, a 2.0x multiplier is mathematically difficult without an external "regime change" in lithium prices which the prompt excludes.

Verdict: **Unlikely**

Monitoring metrics: Phase 2 commissioning date; quarterly spodumene recovery %; cash cost per tonne (target &lt;$500); interest coverage ratio; total shares outstanding (quarterly); quarterly free cash flow; average realized price premium vs. spodumene index; working capital balance; Minas Gerais regulatory status.
