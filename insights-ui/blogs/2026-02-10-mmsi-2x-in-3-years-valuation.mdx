title: 'Can Merit Medical (MMSI) Stock Double in 3 Years? A 3-Anchor Valuation Breakdown'
abstract: 'This article breaks down whether Merit Medical Systems (MMSI) can realistically deliver 2× returns over the next three years using three non-overlapping valuation anchors: EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue, and EV/FCF. It shows what growth, margin improvement, cash conversion, leverage, and multiple changes would be required—and what is more likely based on the company’s recent financial history.'

## 0) Overall analysis

Merit Medical is in a fairly durable part of healthcare: disposable devices and procedure kits tied to ongoing procedure volumes, where demand tends to grow steadily (not explosively) as populations age and minimally invasive care expands. The stock also trades like a “quality compounder,” meaning investors usually pay up for consistent execution—so big upside often requires genuinely better-than-expected fundamentals rather than a sudden valuation rerating. The company’s recent results show real operating improvement, especially in margins, which supports continued earnings compounding, but the starting valuation is still not cheap versus its own history and broad med-device peers. Revenue: ~$964m (FY20) → ~$1.36b (FY24); EBIT margin ~4.8% → ~11.7%; shares ~55.6m → ~58.7m; net debt ~-$382m → ~-$418m. The single biggest reason 2× is hard here is that Merit’s valuation multiples have historically been fairly sticky (not prone to huge reratings), so a 2× outcome would need the business to compound per-share cash earnings far faster than its normal path for three straight years.

## 1) PRIMARY framework / anchor: EV/EBITDA

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/EBITDA is the best primary anchor for MMSI because it matches how this business creates value: steady procedure-driven revenue, incremental margin expansion from mix and manufacturing efficiency, and periodic M&A that changes debt levels. Using FY2024 as the latest full-year baseline provided, EBITDA was ~$262m. With CURRENT_PRICE at $82.60 and ~58.7m shares, the equity value is roughly ~$4.9b; adding net debt of roughly ~$0.4b implies an enterprise value near ~$5.3b, or about ~20× EV/EBITDA on this FY2024 baseline. Historically (last ~5 fiscal years in the data you provided), EV/EBITDA has tended to sit in the low-20s for MMSI, which matters because it suggests “multiple expansion” is usually not the main driver of returns for this stock.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× price in 3 years implies roughly ~26% per year. In plain terms, that means either (a) EBITDA per share must grow close to ~2× over the period, or (b) valuation must rerate sharply upward, or (c) some mix of both—plus any help from debt paydown—while dilution does not eat away the gains.

For EV/EBITDA specifically, a clean 2× path usually needs a combination like: EBITDA up ~70%–90% (roughly ~20%–25% per year), the EV/EBITDA multiple holding steady or even expanding a bit, and net debt falling so more of the enterprise value accrues to equity holders. That can work mechanically because debt paydown “unlocks” equity value, but it still requires unusually strong, sustained EBITDA compounding for a company that is already operating at improved margins.

Based on the company history you provided, the more typical building blocks look like this: revenue growth that is usually high single digits, plus margin expansion that has been meaningful recently but is unlikely to stay at the same pace forever. A reasonable forward path (grounded in that history and the reality of hospital purchasing pressure) is revenue growing ~6%–9% per year (about ~1.19× to ~1.30× over 3 years) and EBITDA growing ~10%–14% per year (about ~1.33× to ~1.48× over 3 years), helped by some continued efficiency gains and mix, but limited by competitive pricing and the fact that margins have already stepped up a lot since FY2020.

When you compare “required” to “likely,” the gap is mostly in the compounding rate: a ~1.33×–~1.48× EBITDA outcome is very different from the ~1.7×–~2.0× EBITDA outcome that typically underwrites a 2× equity return when the multiple is already high. Net: fundamentals ~1.33× to ~1.48×; valuation ~0.85× to ~1.05×; per-share ~0.98× to ~1.02×; total ~1.20× to ~1.60×. 2× needs sustained ~high-teens to ~20%+ EBITDA growth plus “no derating” (or mild rerating) and clean execution that is above the company’s normal history.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A realistic base case is that EBITDA compounds around ~12% per year, which is about ~1.40× over 3 years, because Merit can still grow procedure-linked revenue in high single digits and expand margins modestly from mix and efficiency—but not repeat the full step-change in margins indefinitely. On valuation, because the stock already sits around ~20× EV/EBITDA on the FY2024 baseline, it is more conservative to assume flat-to-slightly lower multiples (for example, drifting toward ~19×) rather than a big expansion; that is about a ~0.95× multiple effect. Per-share effects are small but real: shares have generally risen (stock-based comp and issuance), which is a mild headwind, partly offset if the company uses growing cash flow to pay down debt so that more enterprise value accrues to equity holders; together that is roughly “near-neutral” around ~1.00× in a normal case.

Putting those pieces together gives a base-case 3-year price multiplier of about ~1.35×, with a defensible range of ~1.20×–~1.60×. Using CURRENT_PRICE $82.60, that implies a base-case 3-year price around ~$111.51 and a 3-year price range of roughly ~$99.12 to ~$132.16.

## 2) CROSS-CHECK framework / anchor #1: EV/Revenue

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/Revenue is a useful cross-check for MMSI because the business sells a large catalog of disposable products and procedure kits where top-line growth is tied to procedure volumes, portfolio breadth, and hospital workflow adoption, and where investor narratives often start with “revenue durability” before debating margins. On the FY2024 baseline provided, revenue was ~$1.36b; with CURRENT_PRICE $82.60 and net debt roughly ~$0.4b, EV is roughly ~$5.3b, implying about ~3.9× EV/Revenue. Over the last several fiscal years in your dataset, EV/Revenue has generally lived in a mid-3× to low-4× zone, suggesting that even here, massive multiple swings have not historically been the main return driver.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× outcome in 3 years (~26% per year) is very hard to achieve through EV/Revenue because revenue itself almost never doubles in three years for a mature med-device supplier unless there is major M&A. If the EV/Revenue multiple stays roughly where it is, revenue per share would need to get close to ~2× (again, about ~26% per year), which is far outside the company’s recent revenue growth history.

So the only way EV/Revenue can “explain” a 2× outcome is if both the fundamentals and the multiple do heavy lifting: for example, revenue growth jumps into the mid-teens for three straight years and the EV/Revenue multiple expands meaningfully as investors decide the business deserves a much higher premium. The problem is that a meaningful EV/Revenue rerating usually requires either a clear step up in organic growth durability, or a strong margin structure that starts to resemble best-in-class medtech, or both—otherwise investors resist paying much more per dollar of sales.

Looking at the company’s recent history, a grounded revenue path is still high single digits, not mid-teens. The FY2020–FY2024 revenue progression you provided supports something like ~6%–9% per year as a central tendency absent a large acquisition, because procedure volumes are steady but not hyper-growth, and hospital purchasing behavior tends to cap pricing power. That is about ~1.19×–~1.30× revenue growth over 3 years, before considering dilution.

Against that, the “required” path for 2× is simply too far. Net: fundamentals (revenue) ~1.19× to ~1.30×; valuation ~0.90× to ~1.05×; per-share ~0.98× to ~1.02×; total ~1.10× to ~1.45×. 2× needs a growth regime shift (mid-teens organic growth or a very large, very successful acquisition) plus a meaningful multiple rerating—both of which are above the company’s normal pattern.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A realistic base case under EV/Revenue is revenue compounding around ~7% per year (about ~1.23× over 3 years), because that aligns with the company’s recent growth range and the broader reality that procedure-driven categories tend to expand steadily but not explosively. On valuation, it is conservative to assume the EV/Revenue multiple is flat to slightly down from ~3.9×, because the multiple is already in a “quality” zone and higher rates or any growth wobble typically compress sales multiples first; that frames a modest ~0.95× multiple effect. Per-share effects again are close to neutral: mild dilution is a headwind, partly offset if net debt declines over time, leaving the combined per-share factor near ~1.00×.

That combination points to a base-case 3-year multiplier around ~1.25×, with a defensible range of ~1.10×–~1.45×. Using CURRENT_PRICE $82.60, the implied base-case 3-year price is about ~$103.25, with an implied range of roughly ~$90.86 to ~$119.77.

## 3) CROSS-CHECK framework / anchor #2: EV/FCF (FCF yield)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/FCF is the most practical “owner return” cross-check for MMSI because (unlike high-capex medtech platforms) this business can turn a meaningful share of earnings into free cash flow, and management can use that cash to reduce debt after acquisitions and reinvest in the portfolio. On the FY2024 baseline you provided, free cash flow was ~$186m; with EV roughly ~$5.3b at CURRENT_PRICE, that’s about ~28× EV/FCF (or a mid-3% FCF yield) on that baseline. The key nuance is that FCF has been volatile year-to-year in your data (working capital and timing effects matter), so this anchor is about “normalized” cash power rather than any single year.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

The 2× hurdle (~26% per year) is especially demanding in EV/FCF terms because if the EV/FCF multiple is roughly stable, FCF per share needs to approach ~2× over three years—which typically implies sustained ~25%–30% annual FCF growth. That kind of compounding generally requires both strong revenue growth and expanding margins, plus improving cash conversion, all at once.

To make 2× plausible under this anchor, you would usually need a story like: FCF grows ~1.7×–~2.0× (for example, driven by continued gross margin gains, disciplined SG&A, and better working capital), the EV/FCF multiple does not compress (or even expands), and net debt falls materially so equity captures more of the enterprise value—while dilution remains modest. Mechanically, that can get you there, but it is a “nothing goes wrong” path.

What is more consistent with the provided history is that FCF can be strong, but it is not perfectly smooth. A grounded forward assumption is FCF compounding around ~10%–15% per year (roughly ~1.33×–~1.52× over 3 years), reflecting continued profit growth but also acknowledging that working capital and integration costs can temporarily suppress reported free cash flow in any given year.

So the gap versus 2× is again that the required compounding rate is above normal. Net: fundamentals (FCF) ~1.33× to ~1.52×; valuation ~0.85× to ~1.05×; per-share ~0.98× to ~1.03×; total ~1.15× to ~1.65×. 2× needs sustained high-teens to ~20%+ FCF growth plus “no multiple compression” and clean debt paydown—above what the company typically shows through a full cycle.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

A realistic base case is FCF compounding around ~13% per year, or about ~1.44× over 3 years, because earnings have been compounding and margins have improved, but cash conversion is not guaranteed to improve every year in a straight line. Given the stock is not obviously cheap on cash metrics (an EV/FCF multiple in the high-20s on the FY2024 baseline), it is conservative to assume some multiple pressure over time (for example, drifting toward ~25×), which is roughly a ~0.90× valuation effect, rather than assuming investors pay more for each dollar of FCF. Per-share effects are again close to neutral overall: modest dilution is a mild headwind, and debt paydown is a mild tailwind.

That yields a base-case 3-year multiplier around ~1.40×, with a defensible range of ~1.15×–~1.65×. Using CURRENT_PRICE $82.60, the implied base-case 3-year price is about ~$115.64, with an implied 3-year price range of roughly ~$94.99 to ~$136.29.

## 4) Final conclusion

Across the three non-overlapping anchors, the consistent message is that MMSI can plausibly compound value, but a full 2× in three years would require a compounding rate meaningfully above its normal “high-single-digit revenue plus gradual margin improvement” profile, and it would also require little-to-no valuation compression from already premium multiples. Triangulating the anchors gives a most likely 3-year multiplier range of ~1.30×–~1.60×, with a midpoint around ~1.45×; that corresponds to roughly “fundamentals ~1.30×–~1.50×, valuation ~0.90×–~1.05×, per-share ~0.98×–~1.03×.” The 2× verdict is **Unlikely** on a realistic base case, because it would need sustained high-teens to ~20%+ EBITDA/FCF growth and a stable-to-higher multiple despite already strong starting valuation. The single swing factor that would most likely change the answer is whether Merit can keep expanding operating margins materially while holding growth in the high single digits (or better) without triggering pricing pushback—because that is what could justify “no derating” (or mild rerating). With CURRENT_PRICE $82.60 (Feb 10, 2026), the midpoint implied 3-year price is about ~$119.77 and the implied 3-year price range is roughly ~$107.38 to ~$132.16; in plain English, “~1.45× means ~$82.60 could become about ~$120, with a realistic band of about ~$107–$132.”
