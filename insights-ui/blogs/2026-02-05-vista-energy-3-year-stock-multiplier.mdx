## A) Anchor selection

For Vista Energy today, the best **PRIMARY anchor is EV/EBITDA**, because this is a shale E&P business where investors are fundamentally paying for a stream of operating cash earnings generated by depleting assets that must be continuously reinvested in. EBITDA is the cleanest “operating engine” metric here: it captures volume growth and unit-cost improvements quickly, while avoiding the noise of heavy depreciation and the capital-structure differences that can swing equity returns in commodity businesses. A pure **P/E** anchor is less suitable as the primary lens because net income for upstream producers can be distorted by taxes, FX, and non-operating items, and it can look “cheap” right before a downcycle; meanwhile a pure **FCF yield** anchor can be misleading in a growth phase because high drilling capex can temporarily suppress (or flip) free cash flow even if the underlying wells are earning strong returns (your FY24 shows negative FCF despite strong EBITDA and operating cash flow).

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #1 is P/Operating Cash Flow (P/OCF) per share**, because in this business the _quality_ of EBITDA is judged by how much cash actually shows up after working capital, cash taxes, and interest—especially important for Argentina-exposed producers where cash timing and cash traps can matter. This anchor becomes more informative than EV/EBITDA when capex is lumpy (growth vs maintenance) and when reported profits can be noisy, because operating cash flow is closer to what can service debt, fund drilling, and eventually support buybacks/dividends. It also forces a per-share reality check: if share count rises (as Vista’s has), the equity value cannot compound at the same rate as the business unless cash flow **per share** keeps up.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #2 is EV per proved reserves (EV/1P BOE)**, because it explicitly catches the biggest blind spot in single-year earnings anchors: depletion and the need to replace reserves over time. Vista is a one-basin shale story, so the durability of the inventory and the ability to add reserves economically matter almost as much as this year’s EBITDA; EV/1P also helps prevent “growth optics” that are actually just a pull-forward of future barrels. This second check is essential because Vista can grow by drilling faster, but if that growth is funded by dilution or leverage and does not translate into more reserves **per share**, the long-term intrinsic value per share grows far less than headline production.

## B) The 3–4 driver framework

**Driver 1: Production growth and realized pricing (the revenue/EBITDA volume engine).** For an upstream producer, the simplest economic reality is “barrels times price”; everything else is second-order. Vista disclosed production of **126.8 Mboe/d in Q3 2025**, up **74% year-over-year**, which shows the company has recently been in a rapid ramp phase rather than a low-growth harvest phase. This driver feeds directly into EV/EBITDA because, holding costs and pricing stable, higher volumes lift EBITDA. It also feeds into P/OCF because higher volumes generally raise cash generation—unless working capital, taxes, or receivable collection dynamics absorb the benefit.

**Driver 2: Unit costs and operating efficiency (the margin protection lever).** In shale, the business “wins” by turning geology into repeatable manufacturing, which shows up as lower lifting costs and lower drilling-and-completion costs per well, allowing the company to earn cash margins even if pricing is not a tailwind. Vista highlights lifting cost of **~$4.4/boe in Q3 2025**, and D&C cost improvements from **~$14.2m per well in 2024** to **~$12.1m per well in 2H 2025**, with a stated path toward **~$11.0m** by 2028. The reason this matters to EV/EBITDA is straightforward: in a similar oil-price regime, lowering $/boe costs widens EBITDA margins and makes EBITDA more resilient through volatility; it also matters to P/OCF because lower operating costs tend to be “real cash” savings (not accounting).

**Driver 3: Reinvestment intensity (capex vs cash generation).** Shale declines fast, so production growth is not free—it is purchased with drilling capex, and that capex determines whether the equity earns a “growth multiple” or a “cash return multiple.” In your FY24 cash flow, Vista produced **~$959m operating cash flow** but spent **~$1.053b capex**, resulting in **~-$94m free cash flow**, which is a classic growth posture: the business can look very profitable on EBITDA while still not generating distributable cash. This driver is the bridge between EV/EBITDA and P/OCF: two companies can have the same EBITDA multiple, but the one that converts more of that EBITDA into cash (without starving the asset base) typically earns better per-share compounding and a more durable valuation.

**Driver 4: Capital structure and share count (the per-share translator).** For equity holders, the stock price depends on _what is left for common shareholders per share_ after net debt and dilution. Vista’s disclosed net leverage ratio was **~1.83×** as of Sep 30, 2025 (and it cites a pro forma net leverage of **~1.49×** including PEPASA as if acquired earlier), which indicates debt is meaningful but not extreme—yet still material enough that changes in leverage can amplify or dampen equity returns. Share count matters too: your market snapshot shows **~104.26m shares out** versus **~96m** in FY24, meaning per-share fundamentals must outrun dilution for the stock to compound; this driver directly affects all three anchors by changing EBITDA/OCF/reserves **per share** even when the company-level totals are growing.

## C) Baseline snapshot

At today’s starting point, Vista trades around **$60.6** with roughly **~104.3m shares** and a market cap of **~$6.4b**, with a trailing P/E around **~8.8×** (your snapshot) and a forward P/E around **~11.5×**, which already tells you the market is not assuming a straight-line continuation of current earnings power. Using your FY24 financials, Vista generated **~$1.65b revenue**, **~$1.04b EBITDA**, and **~$478m net income**; it produced **~$959m operating cash flow** but spent **~$1.05b capex**, leaving **~-$94m free cash flow**, and it ended FY24 with net debt (net cash **~- $780m**). The operational scale has since stepped up meaningfully: Vista’s disclosure document references **~$1.426b adjusted EBITDA** over the twelve months ending Sep 30, 2025 and **126.8 Mboe/d** production in Q3 2025, with proved reserves cited as **375.2 MMboe** (or **518.5 MMboe** on a pro forma basis including PEPASA).

Over the last 3–5 years, the direction is clear: revenue rose from **~$274m (FY20)** to **~$652m (FY21)** to **~$1.19b (FY22)** to **~$1.17b (FY23)** to **~$1.65b (FY24)**, while EBITDA expanded from **~$96m** to **~$367m** to **~$749m** to **~$834m** to **~$1.04b**, and net income moved from **loss (FY20)** to **~$51m (FY21)** to **~$270m (FY22)** to **~$397m (FY23)** to **~$478m (FY24)**. The more nuanced trend is cash and per-share translation: free cash flow swung from negative to strongly positive in FY22 (**~$211m**) and then back to small/negative as growth spending rose, while share count drifted up and debt increased meaningfully into 2025—meaning the company has been reinvesting aggressively to grow, but the per-share “harvest” profile is not yet consistently visible in reported FCF.

## D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”

A **2×** in **3 years** requires roughly **~26% per year** compounding, because “~1.26× per year ≈ ~2.0× over 3 years.” In a broadly similar commodity regime, that level of return usually cannot come from multiple expansion alone (unless risk perception changes dramatically); it typically requires that **per-share** fundamentals—like EBITDA per share or operating cash flow per share—grow at something close to that pace, or at least grow fast enough that a modest rerating plus balance-sheet improvement can bridge the rest. For Vista specifically, the per-share emphasis is critical because dilution and leverage have both been part of the growth toolkit, so “company growth” does not automatically equal “shareholder compounding.”

Under the **EV/EBITDA** anchor, a 2× outcome in a similar regime is easiest to see if **EBITDA per share roughly doubles**, because if the multiple stays flat, equity value tends to track enterprise value, and enterprise value tends to track EBITDA. Practically, that means something like “~25–30% EBITDA per-share growth per year for 3 years,” which is a very high bar once you net out dilution. Alternatively, if EBITDA per share rises more moderately—say **~1.5×** over 3 years (which is closer to “mid-teens per year”)—you would need the EV/EBITDA multiple to rise by roughly **~1.3×** (for example from ~5–6× to ~7–8×) and/or net debt to fall meaningfully so that a larger share of enterprise value accrues to equity. Under **P/OCF**, the hurdle is similar but often tougher in growth shale: if the P/OCF multiple stays near where it is, you need operating cash flow **per share** to approach **~2×**; if OCF/share grows ~1.5×, then you again need a material rerating or a strong shift toward capital returns. Under **EV/1P reserves**, a 2× result typically requires either reserves **per share** to grow very fast (hard in 3 years unless M&A is both large and highly accretive per share) or EV per proved barrel to rerate sharply (which usually reflects a meaningful reduction in risk premium or a move to a “developed-market” valuation standard).

Based on Vista’s own history, the most likely 3-year path for the drivers is strong but not “double-speed” on a per-share basis. Volume growth has clearly been high recently (Q3 2025 production +74% YoY), but that pace is rarely sustainable for three full years in shale without either very heavy reinvestment or substantial acquisitions, and both typically come with either higher debt or more shares. A conservative “similar regime” expectation is that production and revenue grow in the **~10–20% per year** zone (not 40–70%), while EBITDA margins remain high but not expand dramatically (your FY24 EBITDA margin is already ~63%), and reinvestment intensity stays elevated (because decline rates force continual drilling). For per-share translation, the history of net share growth and buyback/issuance mix supports assuming **~2–4% per year** net dilution unless management explicitly shifts to sustained buybacks; that means even a healthy **~15% company-level EBITDA growth** can become **~10–12% EBITDA per share** growth.

Industry and business-position logic generally supports that “strong but not heroic” range. Shale wells decline quickly, so production growth is mechanically tied to drilling cadence and capital availability; Vista’s advantage is that it has driven unit costs down and appears to run a “factory drilling” model, which makes **mid-teens** production growth plausible if export access and service availability do not become binding constraints. The offsetting reality is that Argentina sovereign risk, tax/FX policy uncertainty, and periodic domestic pricing distortions typically keep investors from paying U.S.-like “premium” multiples for long periods, which is why multiple expansion is hard to underwrite as the main engine of a 2×. As a sanity check, large U.S. shale peers often trade in the mid-single-digit EV/EBITDA zone (for example Diamondback’s EV/EBITDA is roughly in the **~6×** area in recent data), and emerging-market producers can be lower; Vista already sits in that broad neighborhood on many snapshots, so a rerating big enough to carry half the 2× is not the conservative base case.

Putting “required” next to “likely,” the gap is meaningful across all three anchors. On **EV/EBITDA**, a conservative likely outcome is **~1.3× to ~1.6×** growth in EBITDA **per share** over 3 years (strong growth partially offset by dilution), and a roughly flat to slightly lower multiple if oil prices soften or sovereign risk headlines flare; that tends to map to **~1.3× to ~1.7×** equity upside depending on what happens to net debt. On **P/OCF**, the likely path is similar or slightly lower because high-growth years often absorb cash in working capital and taxes, making OCF/share compounding less clean than EBITDA/share. On **EV/1P reserves**, reserves per share are unlikely to approach a doubling in 3 years without very large M&A, and EV per barrel rerating is hard to underwrite conservatively in Argentina. **Net: fundamentals imply ~1.3× to ~1.7×; 2× requires a sustained ~20%+ per-share growth rate _and/or_ a material rerating plus balance-sheet improvement that are above history/industry/business reality.**

## E) Business reality check

Operationally, Vista “wins” by keeping a high drilling cadence on its best Vaca Muerta inventory while preserving (or improving) unit economics—meaning it must translate technical execution into repeatable wells with low lifting costs, long laterals, and falling D&C costs, so that each incremental barrel adds attractive cash margin. The base-case driver ranges implicitly assume Vista can keep volumes growing at a healthy clip without allowing costs to reflate, which is consistent with its disclosed emphasis on lifting-cost reduction and D&C cost-down; it also assumes export access continues to improve enough that realized pricing remains broadly Brent-linked rather than trapped in domestic caps, because that is what keeps EBITDA margins high for an Argentina producer.

The most realistic constraints are the ones that break either pricing realization or the financing/reinvestment loop. If Argentina policy tightens (export taxes, FX controls, domestic price intervention), the “barrels times price” engine weakens even if volumes grow, and both EV/EBITDA and P/OCF compress because investors haircut the durability of cash repatriation and realized pricing. If service costs inflate or logistics bottleneck (rig availability, frac spreads, takeaway), the cost-down path stalls and margins compress, which directly reduces EBITDA and operating cash flow per barrel. Finally, if Vista continues to rely on debt and equity issuance to fund growth and acquisitions, per-share compounding slows: even if total EBITDA rises, EBITDA **per share** may not, and the equity can lag enterprise growth.

Reconciling the operational story with the numbers, Vista’s base-case path looks plausible as **incremental execution**—keep drilling efficiently, keep costs low, grow production at a still-strong but slower rate than the recent spike—because the company has already demonstrated meaningful operating improvements. What looks less plausible as a _conservative_ expectation is the step-change required for **2×**: it would likely require either sustained hyper-growth **per share** (which is hard in shale without dilution/leverage), or a meaningful rerating of Argentine risk premium (which is outside management’s control), or a rapid shift from growth capex to durable free cash flow plus aggressive buybacks (which would be a strategic change from the recent reinvestment-heavy profile).

## F) Multi-anchor triangulation

### 1) Primary anchor

On the **EV/EBITDA** anchor, the baseline is “mid-single-digit EV/EBITDA” on a run-rate earnings base: FY24 EBITDA is **~$1.04b** on your statements, while Vista’s disclosure document references **~$1.426b adjusted EBITDA** for the twelve months ending Sep 30, 2025, which reflects the step-up in scale. With shares now around **~104m**, the per-share baseline is best thought of as “roughly ~$10–$14 EBITDA per share” depending on whether you anchor to FY24 or the more recent run-rate, and the market is effectively paying a mid-single-digit multiple of that operating engine.

For the next 3 years, the conservative inputs are: company-level EBITDA growth of **~10–18% per year** (supported by continued volume growth and already-low unit costs, but tempered from the recent +74% production growth spike), net share dilution of **~2–4% per year** (consistent with a history that includes both buybacks and issuance), and a roughly **flat multiple** in a similar regime because the current multiple already sits in a range comparable to many shale peers while carrying higher jurisdiction risk. The key reason these are reasonable is that shale growth is feasible with capital and execution, but sustained very high growth typically requires either accelerating capex or M&A—and both tend to reduce per-share accretion unless funded with internally generated free cash flow.

Translating those inputs into a fundamental multiplier: if EBITDA grows **~10–18% per year**, that is roughly **~1.33× to ~1.64×** over 3 years at the company level, and after **~2–4% per year** dilution, EBITDA **per share** becomes roughly **~1.20× to ~1.50×**. With a flat EV/EBITDA multiple, enterprise value would track that range; equity value per share then depends on net debt—if debt is held roughly stable, equity can land near the same range, but if debt rises to fund growth the equity lands toward the low end, and if debt is paid down (or buybacks dominate issuance) it can land toward the high end. That yields a conservative EV/EBITDA-implied **price multiplier of ~1.3× to ~1.7×**, with the low end driven by weaker realized prices or higher leverage, and the high end driven by sustained cost leadership plus a visible transition toward cash returns.

### 2) Cross-check anchor #1

On the **P/OCF** anchor, the baseline is that Vista historically produced strong operating cash flow relative to its size (FY24 OCF **~$959m** on revenue **~$1.65b**), and your ratios show a FY24 **P/OCF around ~5.45×**, implying the market was paying mid-single-digit multiples of operating cash generation. The per-share baseline matters: with share count rising from the mid-90m range to ~104m, FY24 operating cash flow per share moves from roughly “~$10/share” toward “~$9/share” if the numerator does not grow as fast as the denominator, which is why dilution is not a footnote in this stock.

The 3-year inputs for P/OCF need to be slightly more conservative than EBITDA inputs, because operating cash flow can be hit by working capital timing, cash taxes, and interest as the balance sheet grows. A reasonable range is **~8–15% per year** growth in operating cash flow at the company level (slower than EBITDA in years where taxes/working capital normalize), again offset by **~2–4% per year** dilution, giving **~4–13% per year** OCF growth per share. This is consistent with a growth shale model where cash is increasingly generated as scale rises, but where reinvestment and acquisition integration can periodically consume cash even when the wells are profitable.

Turning that into a multiplier, **~4–13% per year** OCF/share growth is roughly **~1.12× to ~1.44×** over 3 years, and if the market continues to pay roughly **mid-single-digit P/OCF**, the stock price tends to track that same range. A modest rerating could add something like **~0.9× to ~1.1×** on top depending on risk sentiment and oil prices, but in a “similar regime” it is conservative to assume this is not a large tailwind. That yields a P/OCF-based 3-year price multiplier of roughly **~1.1× to ~1.6×**, where the low end reflects cash leakage via taxes/working capital and the high end reflects steadier export-linked pricing plus a clearer shift toward cash retention (debt paydown/buybacks).

### 3) Cross-check anchor #2

On the **EV/proved reserves** anchor, the baseline inventory is substantial but also the clearest reminder that this is a depleting asset business: Vista cites certified proved reserves of **375.2 MMboe** and **518.5 MMboe on a pro forma basis** including PEPASA, which is a more relevant “current scale” view of the asset base. In practical terms, today’s enterprise value implies the market is paying a “mid-to-high teens dollars per proved BOE” level on that pro forma reserve base—already not a distressed valuation, and meaning the stock’s upside must come from either growing reserves per share, improving risk perception, or both.

The 3-year inputs here must reflect the mechanics of reserve replacement: reserves can grow if drilling adds more proved barrels than depletion consumes, and if acquisitions add inventory at attractive cost, but both routes usually require capital and sometimes equity issuance. Conservatively, you might underwrite proved reserves growth of **~5–10% per year** at the company level in a strong shale play with active development, but after **~2–4% per year** dilution, reserves **per share** might grow only **~1–7% per year** unless growth is unusually accretive. The reason this is a fair base-case constraint is that reserve booking is not just “more drilling”; it is also price assumptions, development pacing, and the cost of proving up barrels, all of which are real and often cyclical in emerging markets.

Converting that into a multiplier, **~1–7% per year** reserves/share growth equates to roughly **~1.03× to ~1.23×** over 3 years, and if EV per proved barrel stays broadly stable (a conservative “similar regime” assumption given Argentina risk), the enterprise value contribution from this anchor is modest. The estimate lands at the low end if Vista grows production faster than it books reserves (depleting inventory) or if M&A is dilutive per share; it lands at the high end if reserve additions are unusually efficient and the company can fund them with internally generated cash rather than new shares. This cross-check therefore supports the conclusion that a 2× outcome is hard to justify on “asset value rerating” alone; it would need either unusually strong per-share reserve accretion or a meaningful EV/boe rerating.

---

## G) Valuation sanity check

In a similar regime, valuation looks **more neutral-to-headwind than tailwind**, because Vista already trades in a range that overlaps with many U.S. shale valuations on common metrics, despite carrying higher jurisdiction risk. A practical peer framing is that large U.S. shale operators often sit around **mid-single-digit EV/EBITDA** (for example, Diamondback’s recent EV/EBITDA is around the **~6×** area), while large Latin American producers can trade lower (Ecopetrol is often cited in the **~3–5×** EV/EBITDA zone depending on cycle), reflecting higher political risk and state influence. Vista’s “already mid-single-digit” starting point means a major rerating is not the conservative base-case engine for returns.

Translating that into a conservative 3-year valuation multiplier, a reasonable expectation is something like **~0.9× to ~1.1×** from multiple change if the macro regime is broadly similar (oil price range-bound, risk premium still applied to Argentina), with a more optimistic but still plausible upside band of **~1.1× to ~1.3×** only if investors gain confidence that cash generation is durable and capital returns become visible (which reduces the “Argentina discount” without assuming a full regime change). The key point is that even a favorable rerating is unlikely to do the full heavy lifting; fundamentals per share still need to be strong for 2×.

---

## H) Final answer

The **most likely** 3-year price multiplier for Vista is **~1.3× to ~1.7×**, mainly because conservative per-share fundamental growth (strong production and EBITDA growth partially offset by dilution and reinvestment) plausibly compounds in the low-to-mid teens per year, while valuation is more likely to be flat than a major tailwind in a similar regime.

A reasonable **bull-case** is **~1.8× to ~2.3×**, but it requires multiple things to go right at the same time: Vista must sustain unusually strong production growth while keeping unit costs on the cost-down trajectory, convert more EBITDA into operating cash flow without working-capital/tax leakage, and—critically—shift the per-share story through either lower dilution or visible debt paydown/buybacks so that EBITDA and cash flow **per share** compound closer to the ~20%+ zone; on top of that, the market would need to grant a modest rerating (not a heroic one) as cash returns become more believable.

**Borderline.** Monitor quarterly production (Mboe/d); realized oil price ($/bbl) and realized discount/premium vs Brent (%); lifting cost ($/boe); D&C cost ($m per well) and average lateral length (ft); quarterly capex ($m) and capex-to-EBITDA (%); operating cash flow ($m) and OCF margin (%); free cash flow ($m) and FCF per share ($/share); net debt ($m) and net leverage (net debt / EBITDA, x); shares outstanding (m) and net dilution/buyback rate (%); export share of oil sales (%) and any change in export duty/take rate (%).
