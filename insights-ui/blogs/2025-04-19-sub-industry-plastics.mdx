**1.1 Tariff‑Impact Dashboard**

**Effective duty rates on HS 39 (Plastics & Articles) – Pre vs. Post**
Before the new measures, the average Most‑Favored‑Nation (MFN) duty on imported plastics under HS Chapter 39 was approximately **3.1%** according to the U.S. International Trade Commission’s Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) ([hts.usitc.gov/chapter/39](https://hts.usitc.gov/chapter/39)). After Executive Order 14257 (“Liberation Day”), Chinese‑origin plastics face an additional **125%** reciprocal tariff, for an **effective duty of ~128.1%** ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-excludes-smartphones-computers-reciprocal-tariffs-2025-04-12/)).

**Import reliance ratio (% of COGS)**
In February 2025, the U.S. plastics and rubber products manufacturing subsector recorded shipments of **\$24.9 billion** (annualized) in the Census Bureau’s Monthly Manufacturing Report ([census.gov/manufacturing/m3](https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3)). In 2023, total U.S. imports of plastics and rubber were **\$100.4 billion**, of which **\$20.7 billion** (20.6%) came from China, per the Peterson Institute for International Economics ([piie.com blog](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/no-trade-tax-free-trumps-promised-tariffs-will-hit-large-flows)).

**Incremental cost per unit (USD/kg)**
North American polypropylene (PP) prices averaged **\$1.19/kg** in April 2025 ([BusinessAnalytiq](https://businessanalytiq.com/procurementanalytics/index/polypropylene-price-index/)). A 125% tariff adds **\$1.49/kg**, nearly doubling landed cost to **\$2.68/kg**, or **\$0.75** extra for a 0.5 kg part.

**EBITDA margin delta (bps)**
Westlake Corporation’s full‑year 2024 report shows **\$12.1 billion** in net sales and **\$2.3 billion** in EBITDA, implying a **19.0%** margin ([StockTitan](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/WLK/westlake-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-80dqwtgazpi8.html)). With polymer feedstock ~15% of COGS, doubling resin cost raises total COGS by roughly **1.9%**, compressing EBITDA margins by about **190 bps** before any mitigation.

**Abnormal share‑price return (announcement ± 3 days)**
Shares of LyondellBasell (NYSE: LYB) fell from **\$70.95** on April 3, 2025, to **\$59.83** on April 9, 2025—a **15.8%** drop over five trading days ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LYB/history?p=LYB)).

**Management quote on mitigation actions**
“PLASTICS remains deeply concerned about the tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, and their impact on U.S. plastics manufacturing and jobs. We urge policymakers to support balanced trade policies that enhance U.S. competitiveness, reinforce supply chains, and drive continued innovation,” said Matt Seaholm, President & CEO of the Plastics Industry Association ([PLASTICS newsroom](https://www.plasticsindustry.org/newsroom/plastics-industry-association-shares-concern-about-tariffs-urges-trade-policies-that-strengthen-u-s-manufacturing/)).

**Exhibit ideas**
- **Stacked bar** – PP landed cost before vs. after 125% tariff
- **Event line** – LyondellBasell share price vs. tariff announcement dates
- **Bubble chart** – Import reliance vs. EBITDA delta (bubble size = revenue)
- **Waterfall** – EBITDA bridge: base → tariff impact → mitigation actions
- **Heat‑map** – HS 39 sub‑heading vs. pre/post duty rate

**Unique insight**
A **> 125 percentage‑point** jump in duties effectively eliminates Chinese cost advantage, structurally benefiting domestic producers with integrated production and distribution.

**1.2 Investment Thesis at a Glance**

- **Recommendation**: Overweight
- **Current price**: \$59.83 ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LYB?p=LYB))

- **Total return potential**: 33%

**12‑month catalysts**
1. **“Liberation Day” tariffs**: 10% baseline on all imports from April 5, higher for China from April 9 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%27s_Liberation_Day_tariffs)).

2. **Delayed Fed cuts**: “Wait-and-see” on inflation may push rate cuts beyond mid‑2025 ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/with-inflation-progress-slow-feds-daly-says-rate-cuts-may-need-wait-2025-04-18/)).
3. **Feedstock price swings**: Oil-price volatility could squeeze petrochemical margins ([Reuters energy](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-prices-rise-potential-us-tariff-exemptions-cars-pick-up-china-crude-imports-2025-04-15/)).
