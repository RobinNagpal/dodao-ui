## A) Anchor selection

For DEFT, the best **PRIMARY anchor is EV-to-revenue (EV/Revenue) on a trailing basis**, because the business is economically closer to an asset-light “crypto ETP issuer + yield capture” model than a traditional operating company. The core engine (via Valour Inc.) converts AUM into management-fee revenue and, importantly, staking/lending income that behaves like a yield stream; that makes revenue a more direct “throughput” measure than EPS when quarterly earnings can swing with market levels and investment-related line items. This also fits how the market typically values early-stage/volatile financial platforms: investors often start with a sales multiple and then debate durability/quality of that revenue. By contrast, **P/E is less suitable right now** because profitability is not yet a stable “through-cycle” feature, and **P/B is distorted** because the balance sheet contains large structured-product liabilities and assets that don’t map cleanly to distributable equity value per share.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #1 is EV/EBITDA (preferably on a normalized or “through-cycle” view)**, because it becomes more informative precisely when the company demonstrates it can turn revenue into repeatable operating profit without relying on one-off trades or unusually rich yield conditions. EBITDA is the cleanest way to see operating leverage in a platform with high gross margins and potentially scalable costs, and it forces the question that EV/Revenue can gloss over: “How much of each incremental revenue dollar becomes operating cash-like profit?” This check matters here because DEFT has shown quarters of strong profitability, but the historical record includes periods of deep losses, so we need a margin discipline lens alongside revenue scale.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #2 is EV-to-AUM (EV/AUM) or, equivalently, equity value-to-AUM**, because AUM is the true “capacity base” that drives management fees and staking/lending income, and it catches a major blind spot: **fee compression and yield normalization can cause revenue to underperform AUM growth**, even if headline AUM looks healthy. This is especially relevant in crypto ETPs where competitive pressure can push fees down sharply, and where staking economics can change with protocol yields, risk limits, or regulation; EV/AUM forces you to ask what “take-rate” the market is implicitly underwriting per dollar of AUM. It also keeps the analysis tied to per-share reality: if AUM grows but shares grow faster, AUM-per-share can stagnate even while the company “looks bigger.”

## B) The 3–4 driver framework

The first driver is **Valour AUM growth (net inflows + market-level impact)**, because DEFT’s core revenue streams are ultimately a function of how much client money sits in the ETP wrapper. Historically, Valour has demonstrated it can scale AUM meaningfully (for example, reporting a record ~C$838m in early 2024 and surpassing the ~US$1b level by mid-2025), which shows there is a distribution and product engine that can attract assets in a “normal” crypto environment rather than requiring a once-in-a-decade regime shift. AUM growth is the most direct input into **EV/AUM** (obviously) and also drives **EV/Revenue** because fees and yield income expand as the asset base expands.

The second driver is **net revenue yield on AUM (the blended “take-rate” from management fees plus net staking/lending income retained by the firm)**, because two companies with the same AUM can produce very different revenue depending on fee schedule, product mix, and whether staking economics accrue to investors or to the issuer. DEFT has explicitly highlighted that staking/lending can be a large contributor (e.g., citing Q1 2025 staking/lending income of about US$10m and management fees of about US$2.6m), which implies the revenue model is not just a low-fee “ETF-like” business. The reason this driver must be treated conservatively is that industry pricing pressure is real—some competing crypto ETPs have pushed fees to very low levels in competitive markets, which can structurally compress the fee portion of the take-rate and force more reliance on yield capture. This driver directly affects **EV/Revenue** (quality/level of sales) and determines whether a given **EV/AUM** is cheap or expensive.

The third driver is **operating expense discipline and sustainable EBITDA margin**, because a platform-like issuer can show dramatic operating leverage when revenue is strong, but can also see margins evaporate if revenue normalizes while costs remain geared for growth. In DEFT’s own reported results, there are quarters with very strong operating profitability (for example, a Q3 2025 press release referencing revenue of ~US$22.5m and operating income of ~US$9m), which demonstrates that “good quarters” can be very good. The conservative question is not whether such quarters can happen, but whether the _mid-cycle_ EBITDA margin can stay positive and reasonably high when revenue is less favorable; that’s why this driver ties most directly to **EV/EBITDA** and serves as a reality check on EV/Revenue.

The fourth driver is **share count change (dilution) and capital structure positioning (net cash vs leverage)**, because DEFT’s per-share outcomes depend as much on how growth is financed as on the growth itself. The company has had periods of meaningful share count expansion (for example, the user-provided history shows shares outstanding rising from ~296m in FY2024 to ~386m recently), and there are quarters where equity issuance is a major cash source, which tells you management is willing to fund the platform with equity when opportunities arise. This matters because **even if enterprise value doubles, the stock may not double if shares rise materially**, and it also affects EV-based anchors: net cash can reduce EV, but if that net cash comes from dilution, per-share value doesn’t automatically improve. This driver links to _all three anchors_ because it changes revenue-per-share, EBITDA-per-share, and AUM-per-share—each of which is what ultimately compounds into stock price.

## C) Baseline snapshot

As of the provided snapshot, DEFT is around **~US$0.8 per share** with **~US$299m market cap** and **~386m shares outstanding**, and trailing revenue is shown as **~US$68m TTM**. On a capital structure view, the most recent quarter you provided (Q3 2025) shows the balance sheet flipping to meaningful net cash (net cash around **~US$109m** and total debt around **~US$16m**), which implies an enterprise value meaningfully below market cap; directionally, that places EV roughly in the **~US$190m** neighborhood using that quarter’s net cash position. Operationally, the company has shown quarters with strong reported profitability (for example, reported Q3 2025 revenue of ~US$22.5m and operating income of ~US$9m), which is the key reason the market even entertains an EBITDA-based rerating story.

Over the last 3–5 years in your provided statements, the company’s financial trajectory is best described as **rapid scaling with extreme volatility and heavy financing activity**. Revenue moved from very small levels in the early years to **~US$38m in FY2024**, and then to much higher quarterly run-rates in parts of 2025, but the path included unusual swings (including a year where reported revenue appears negative in the dataset), which is a reminder that “revenue” here is not like selling widgets—mix, accounting classification, and market-linked income can dominate. Meanwhile, profitability has swung from very large losses in FY2021–FY2024 to pockets of profitability in 2025, implying operating leverage exists but is not yet proven as a stable mid-cycle baseline. The most consistent per-share pattern is that the share count rose substantially across the period, which means any valuation work has to start from _per-share compounding_ rather than simply assuming that scaling the platform automatically scales the stock.

## D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”

A **2× price outcome in 3 years** is roughly a **~26% per year compound return** (because ~1.26× each year for 3 years ≈ ~2.0×). For DEFT, the hurdle is higher than that in _fundamental_ terms if dilution continues: if shares rise, say, **~5% per year** (a moderate assumption given history), the share count is ~**1.16×** higher in 3 years, and a **2× stock price would require ~2.3× market cap** (because 2.0× price × 1.16× shares ≈ 2.32×). That means the underlying value created by the business has to grow closer to “a bit more than double” at the enterprise/equity level, not merely keep pace with a doubling of the quote.

By anchor, the “2× must be true” statement looks different. On the **primary EV/Revenue** anchor, if the multiple is stable, then **revenue per share must roughly double**, which in plain terms means total revenue needs to grow faster than dilution (for example, ~30% total revenue growth over 3 years is only ~1.3×, and if shares are up ~1.16×, revenue per share is only ~1.12×—not remotely enough). Alternatively, if revenue per share grows ~1.4×, you would still need a meaningful **multiple expansion** (for example, ~1.4× fundamentals times ~1.4× multiple ≈ ~2.0×), which is hard to justify in a “similar regime” unless revenue quality and durability improve. On **EV/EBITDA**, 2× is achievable either by doubling **EBITDA per share** (through AUM growth + stable take-rate + cost discipline) or by a smaller EBITDA-per-share increase combined with a rerating from “skeptical” to “credible,” but that rerating only sticks if profitability is repeatable across multiple quarters. On **EV/AUM**, 2× usually requires either **AUM-per-share growth approaching ~2×** (meaning AUM growth well above dilution) or a higher market-implied “take-rate” per AUM dollar; however, fee compression risk makes a large EV/AUM rerating less automatic than it sounds.

Using the company’s own history as the constraint, the **most likely** 3-year driver ranges are more moderate than the headline “crypto boom” narratives. A conservative but realistic base case is **AUM growth of ~10%–20% per year** (≈ ~1.33× to ~1.73× over 3 years), because Valour has already demonstrated it can gather assets, but maintaining >30% annual AUM growth without a regime shift is difficult for a smaller platform competing against very large providers. For the **net revenue yield**, a reasonable conservative stance is **flat to down modestly** (for example, -5% to -20% over 3 years) because fee pressure is structurally rising, and any unusually strong yield capture is unlikely to be extrapolated without haircut. For **EBITDA margin**, the history argues for caution: rather than assuming Q3-like margins persist, a conservative “durable” range is **~15%–25% EBITDA margin** on a mid-cycle revenue base, reflecting that the model can be profitable but may not be consistently “windfall” profitable. For **dilution**, the company’s past makes **~3%–7% per year** a fair base-case band (≈ ~1.09× to ~1.23× shares over 3 years) unless management explicitly pivots to self-funding and buybacks.

Industry logic pushes the same direction: **distribution and fees are getting more competitive**, and that typically pushes the economics of ETP issuance toward “scale wins” unless a smaller issuer has a differentiated edge (speed-to-market, niche products, or yield mechanics). The public record shows that fee competition in crypto ETPs can become aggressive (with products in some markets charging fees as low as the low-tenths of a percent, and even temporarily ~0.05% in the most intense price wars), which means assuming a stable or rising take-rate is not conservative. DEFT’s offset is that its model has emphasized staking/lending income in addition to fees, which can protect revenue per AUM when fees compress—but a conservative view assumes that part of the economics also normalizes over time as competitors emulate, protocols change yields, or regulators constrain how much yield the issuer can retain.

Putting “required vs likely” together, the multi-anchor gap is clear. Under **EV/Revenue**, a 2× outcome wants something like **~1.8×–2.2× revenue growth** plus only modest dilution, or else a big multiple expansion; the likely path looks more like **~1.3×–1.7× revenue growth** before dilution and **~1.1×–1.4× revenue-per-share growth** after dilution, which points to something well short of 2× unless multiples expand. Under **EV/EBITDA**, 2× requires **EBITDA-per-share** to rise roughly **~2×** or at least **~1.5×** with a supportive rerating; the likely path can deliver **~1.2×–1.7× EBITDA-per-share** if margins stay positive and dilution cools, but it still needs above-base execution to reach 2×. Under **EV/AUM**, 2× usually needs AUM-per-share to approach **~2×** or EV/AUM to rerate upward, while the likely AUM-per-share band is closer to **~1.15×–1.55×** once dilution is included; that implies 2× is more a bull-case than a base-case. Net: fundamentals imply ~**1.2× to ~1.7×**; 2× requires **sustained high AUM growth, durable yield economics, and materially lower dilution** than history supports in a competitive fee environment.

## E) Business reality check

Operationally, DEFT “wins” by doing three mundane-but-hard things repeatedly: keeping Valour’s product shelf relevant enough to pull **net inflows**, retaining enough of the economics (fees plus net yield capture) that AUM growth turns into **real revenue growth**, and scaling the platform so operating costs grow slower than revenue. In practice, that means steady expansion of distribution channels and listings, staying early on new investable assets without creating blow-up risks, and making the staking/lending component systematic rather than opportunistic, so the revenue yield is not just a function of “one good quarter.” To make the base-case driver ranges work, the company also needs to fund growth with a **lighter equity-issuance footprint** than the past, because every extra ~5% annual share growth materially raises the market-cap growth required to get a per-share 2× outcome.

The most realistic constraints are not abstract—they map directly to the drivers. Fee and product competition can force **take-rate compression**, breaking the revenue-yield driver even if AUM grows, and recent market behavior shows that fee wars can get intense in crypto ETPs. AUM can also be “fragile” because it is partly driven by underlying crypto prices; in a “similar regime,” you should assume some drawdowns happen, which can cause revenue volatility and make margin sustainability harder. On the balance sheet and funding side, if management continues to use equity issuance to fund expansion, it can break the per-share compounding even if the business improves—this is the most common failure mode for small-cap financial platforms with volatile earnings.

Reconciling the operational reality with the numbers, the **base-case path is plausible** if you interpret it as incremental execution: moderate AUM growth, slightly lower but still meaningful revenue yield, and costs growing slower than revenue, while dilution slows to mid-single digits. What is **not plausible as a “default”** is the step-change required for 2× without a favorable tailwind: you would need a sustained run of strong profitability that convinces the market to pay a higher multiple _and_ a financing posture that doesn’t dilute away that value creation. In other words, the base-case does not require miracles, but a 2× outcome requires the company to prove that its best quarters are not exceptions and that shareholder value is not continuously recycled into new shares.

## F) Multi-anchor triangulation

### 1) Primary anchor

On the **EV/Revenue** anchor, the baseline is roughly “a few turns of sales”: using the provided TTM revenue of ~US$68m and a market cap around ~US$299m, the equity P/S is about ~4×–5×, while using the latest provided net cash position suggests EV is meaningfully lower than market cap, putting EV/Revenue closer to the ~3× area on that snapshot. The key point is that today’s valuation already prices DEFT as more than a distressed asset but not as a high-confidence compounder, which is consistent with a business that can generate strong quarters but has not proven a smooth earnings profile.

For the next three years, a conservative input set is: **revenue growth ~8%–18% per year** (≈ ~1.26× to ~1.64× over 3 years), built from **AUM growth ~10%–20% per year** tempered by modest net yield compression; **share count growth ~3%–7% per year** (≈ ~1.09× to ~1.23× over 3 years), reflecting the company’s historical willingness to issue stock but assuming it moderates; and an **EV/Revenue multiple that is flat to slightly lower** (for example, 0.9×–1.1×) because fee competition makes large multiple expansion hard in a similar regime. The reason these are “reasonable” is that Valour has already demonstrated the ability to reach scale in AUM, but the public fee environment makes it imprudent to assume take-rate expansion, and the company’s own history makes a sudden stop to dilution an aggressive assumption.

Translating that into a 3-year fundamental multiplier in plain English, total revenue at ~1.26×–1.64× combined with shares at ~1.09×–1.23× implies **revenue per share** of roughly **~1.03× to ~1.50×** (because 1.26/1.23 ≈ 1.02 on the low end, and 1.64/1.09 ≈ 1.50 on the high end). If the EV/Revenue multiple is roughly flat (say 0.9×–1.1×), the implied **price multiplier** from this anchor is about **~0.9× to ~1.7×**, with the “more likely middle” clustering around **~1.2×–1.5×**; the low end happens if yield/fees compress faster than AUM grows and dilution stays high, while the high end needs steady inflows, stable net yield economics, and a clear reduction in equity issuance.

### 2) Cross-check anchor #1

On **EV/EBITDA**, the baseline is inherently less stable because historical EBITDA has swung from negative in FY2024 (your provided FY2024 EBITDA was about -US$15m) to strongly positive in certain 2025 quarters (for example, Q3 2025 showed EBITDA around ~US$11m in the provided quarterly statement, and the company also reports “adjusted EBITDA” in some releases). That volatility is exactly why this is a cross-check: it asks what EBITDA looks like when you assume the business is not always in an unusually favorable quarter, and it forces a judgment on a sustainable mid-cycle margin.

A conservative 3-year input set here is: revenue growth consistent with the base case above; a **sustainable EBITDA margin of ~15%–25%** (not the peak quarter), because the model can be profitable but competition and revenue volatility argue against extrapolating the best prints; and dilution in the **~3%–7% per year** band, because per-share EBITDA is what the stock ultimately compounds on. On the multiple, assume **EV/EBITDA is roughly flat to modestly lower** (0.85×–1.10×) because the market typically pays higher EBITDA multiples only after profitability is consistent across multiple quarters, and crypto-linked financials rarely get a “set-and-forget” rerating without that evidence.

With those inputs, the math is: if revenue is ~1.26×–1.64× over 3 years and EBITDA margin stays in the ~15%–25% band, **EBITDA dollars** can plausibly grow about **~1.3× to ~2.0×** (the lower end is modest growth plus margin normalization; the higher end is stronger revenue growth plus some operating leverage). Adjusting for dilution (divide by ~1.09×–1.23×), **EBITDA per share** becomes roughly **~1.1× to ~1.8×**, and then applying a 0.85×–1.10× multiple effect yields an implied price multiplier of about **~0.9× to ~2.0×**. The high end is reachable only if DEFT proves that positive EBITDA is durable (so the market does not haircut the multiple) _and_ dilution is controlled; if either fails, this anchor tends to converge back toward the ~1.2×–1.6× region rather than delivering a clean 2×.

### 3) Cross-check anchor #2

On **EV/AUM**, the baseline reference point is that Valour’s AUM has been reported around the high hundreds of millions to above the **~US$1b** level in the 2024–2025 period, while DEFT’s equity value in the provided snapshot is around **~US$300m**, implying equity value/AUM on the order of **~0.3×** and EV/AUM meaningfully lower if net cash is substantial. This anchor is useful because it translates valuation into an implied “platform take-rate and margin” assumption: a low EV/AUM can still be expensive if net economics per AUM dollar are being competed away.

For inputs, assume **AUM growth ~10%–20% per year** (≈ ~1.33×–1.73× over 3 years) consistent with “similar regime” but still allowing net inflows; assume **dilution ~3%–7% per year** (≈ ~1.09×–1.23×) so we focus on AUM per share; and assume **EV/AUM is flat to slightly down** (0.8×–1.05× on the multiple) because fee competition is a structural headwind and can prevent the market from paying a higher “platform premium” per AUM dollar. The reason this is conservative is straightforward: the industry has shown it will cut fees aggressively, and a smaller issuer rarely gets a sustained valuation premium per AUM unless it has clearly defensible distribution or differentiated economics.

Plain-English math: AUM at ~1.33×–1.73× divided by share count at ~1.09×–1.23× implies **AUM per share** of roughly **~1.08× to ~1.59×**. If EV/AUM is roughly flat (0.8×–1.05×), the implied price multiplier is about **~0.9× to ~1.7×**, which again centers below 2× in a base case. To reach ~2× on this anchor, you generally need either **AUM growth materially above ~20% per year** _and_ dilution below ~3% per year, or a meaningful rerating of EV/AUM—yet a rerating is exactly what fee wars and yield normalization tend to fight against.

---

## G) Valuation sanity check

In a “similar regime,” valuation looks more like **neutral to mild headwind** than a reliable tailwind. The reason is that crypto ETP economics are getting more price-competitive (which tends to compress the quality and durability multiple investors will pay), and the market is unlikely to reward DEFT with a sustained multiple expansion unless it proves a consistent earnings profile across multiple quarters. Said differently: DEFT can still be a strong stock if fundamentals compound, but counting on “the market just paying up” is not conservative when the industry backdrop is pushing fees down.

A practical conservative way to encode that is a **valuation multiplier of ~0.85× to ~1.15× over three years**, meaning multiples are roughly flat with room for modest expansion if profitability stabilizes, but also real risk of compression if revenue quality is questioned or dilution persists. This range fits the regime assumption because it does not require a crypto supercycle (which would usually drive sharp reratings), and it respects the reality that competitive fee pressure can slowly grind down the “platform premium” even when AUM is growing.

---

## H) Final answer

The **most likely 3-year price multiplier** for DEFT, using the three-anchor triangulation above, is about **~1.2× to ~1.6×**, mainly because a conservative AUM growth path (roughly mid-teens annually) combined with some take-rate pressure and ongoing dilution tends to produce only mid-teens-ish per-share fundamental compounding, and valuation is more likely to be flat than to expand meaningfully.

A reasonable **bull-case** is **~1.8× to ~2.4×**, but it requires several things to go right simultaneously: AUM needs to compound closer to the mid-20% range annually without a major regime shift, the net revenue yield must remain meaningfully supported by staking/lending economics rather than being competed away, EBITDA must stay durably positive at something like a mid-20% margin on a normalized revenue base, and—crucially—share count growth needs to fall to low single digits so the business-level improvement actually shows up per share.

**Borderline.** Monitor: Valour AUM (US$); net inflows per quarter (US$); blended management-fee rate (basis points of AUM); staking/lending income per quarter (US$); total revenue per quarter (US$); adjusted EBITDA per quarter (US$) and EBITDA margin (%); operating expenses as % of revenue; shares outstanding (millions) and quarterly dilution (%); net cash (US$) and net cash per share (US$); operating cash flow and free cash flow per quarter (US$).
