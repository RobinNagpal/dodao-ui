# REIT Debt Types and Structure

When analyzing a **Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)**, understanding its **debt structure** is as critical as examining its **cost framework**. In this discussion, we focus solely on the types of **debt instruments** and **financial obligations** associated with REITs, using **Front View REIT** as an example. 

Although we are focusing on **equity REITs**, they also incorporate **debt** as a crucial component of their **capital structure**.

This **debt** can be deployed for various purposes, such as financing new **property acquisitions**, refinancing existing obligations, or supporting strategic **growth initiatives**. By leveraging both **equity** and **debt**, Equity REITs optimize their financial flexibility and enhance their overall **investment potential**.

REIT debt generally includes **long-term bonds**, **revolving credit facilities**, and **short-term loans**, each of which plays a significant role in determining the REIT’s **financial leverage**, **risk profile**, and **refinancing needs**. The way a REIT manages its debt influences its capacity to finance new **acquisitions**, sustain **dividend payments**, and navigate **market volatility**. While this analysis emphasizes debt, it’s important to remember that a comprehensive evaluation of a REIT also involves looking at **operating costs**, **property management efficiency**, and **equity structure**, thereby providing a clearer picture of the overall **financial health** and **investment potential**.


## Why You Should Look into a REIT's Debt

Understanding a **REIT's debt** is crucial because the **repayment schedules** and **interest rates** directly impact its **cash flow** and **financial planning**. For example, **NADG NNN PROPERTY FUND LP** has **Asset Backed Securities** with a **3.37% interest rate** that must be repaid by **December 2024**, even though the stated maturity is **December 2049**. This means that if the full amount is not repaid by **December 2024**, **additional interest costs** will start to accrue. If these extra costs occur, the REIT will need to use more **cash** to service its **debt**, leaving less available for everyday **operations**, **property improvements**, or **dividend payments**. Consequently, **higher debt servicing expenses** can reduce the REIT’s overall **profitability** by lowering its **net income**.

## General Overview of Debt Types in REITs

REITs typically utilize a mix of debt instruments to finance property acquisitions, development projects, and operational activities. They often employ long-term financing options such as **permanent loans**, which can include **senior secured debt**, **non-recourse debt**, or **term loans**, offering structured repayment schedules and defined interest terms. For short-term liquidity needs, REITs use instruments like **revolving credit facilities** and **bridge loans**, which provide flexible funding but may carry floating rates and shorter maturities. In addition, some REITs opt for **mezzanine financing**, **subordinated debt**, or even hybrid instruments like **convertible debt**, each with distinct risk profiles and cost implications.


### Detailed Overview of FVR REIT Debt Instruments



1. Asset Backed Securities (ABS Notes)
* **Definition:** ABS Notes are debt instruments secured by a pool of assets—in this case, properties held by the REIT.
* **Interest Rate & Maturity:** They carry a fixed interest rate of **3.37%**. Although the stated maturity date is **December 2049**, the structure requires that any remaining principal be repaid by **December 2024**.
* **Principal & Security:** The outstanding principal is approximately **$253,499K**. The ABS Notes are secured by a portfolio of properties with a carrying value of **$310,635K**, along with assignments of leases and rents, and are guaranteed collectively by the Partnership.
* **Payment Terms:** Interest and scheduled principal payments are made on a monthly basis, starting from January 2020. The notes can be prepaid in whole or in part under specified conditions.
2. Revolving Credit Facility (CIBC Bank USA)
* **Definition:** A revolving credit facility provides the REIT with a flexible line of credit that can be drawn, repaid, and redrawn as needed.
* **Interest Rate & Maturity:** This facility carries an interest rate of **Adjusted Term SOFR + 2.25%** and has a maturity date of **March 8, 2025**.
* **Principal & Security:** The facility has an outstanding principal of around **$150,000K**. It is secured by certain properties, which collectively have a carrying value of approximately **$349,328K**.
* **Terms & Conditions:** The arrangement includes provisions for unused commitment fees, which depend on the level of credit utilization. The credit facility has been amended over time, such as the change from LIBOR to Term SOFR on March 17, 2023.
3. Term Loan (CIBC Bank USA Term Loan)
* **Definition:** A term loan is a type of debt with a fixed repayment schedule over a set period.
* **Interest Rate & Maturity:** This term loan bears an interest rate of **Term SOFR + 1.80%** and is scheduled to mature on **March 31, 2027**.
* **Principal & Security:** The principal balance is approximately **$15,967K**. It is secured by specific properties with a carrying value of **$26,703K**, along with the assignment of rents and leases.
* **Usage:** This loan was assumed by the Partnership during the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in a joint venture. The structure allows for repayments based on net proceeds from property sales, among other potential financing strategies.

## Understanding Interest Rate  


### Weighted Average Interest Rate

The weighted average interest rate represents the overall cost of borrowing across all of a REIT’s outstanding debt instruments, taking into account both the individual interest rates and the proportion of total debt they represent. 

By assigning a higher weight to larger loans and a lower weight to smaller ones, this metric provides a single figure that captures how much the REIT pays, on average, to service its debt. 

It is particularly important in **debt analysis** because it helps gauge the REIT’s total interest expense burden and its potential impact on cash flow and profitability.

In the case of **FVR**, the **weighted average interest rate** was **4.96%** as of **September 30, 2024**, and **5.17%** as of **December 31, 2023**. These figures indicate the REIT’s blended cost of borrowing, reflecting both fixed and variable rate debt and any changes in the interest rate environment over time.

### Variable and Fixed Interest Rates 

Analyzing the interest rate structure is crucial because it directly impacts a REIT's debt servicing costs and overall financial stability. Investors examine these rates to understand potential risks and to forecast future cash flows.



* **Fixed Interest Rates:**
    * **Predictability:** These rates remain constant over the life of the loan, providing stability in debt payments.
    * **Example:** The **ABS Notes** of NADG NNN PROPERTY FUND LP carry a fixed rate of **3.37%**, ensuring that the borrowing cost stays the same regardless of market conditions.
* **Variable Interest Rates:**
    * **Flexibility and Risk:** These rates adjust over time based on market benchmarks like **Term SOFR**. They can initially offer lower costs but expose the REIT to potential increases if market rates rise.
    * **Examples:**
        * The **Revolving Credit Facility** carries an interest rate of **Adjusted Term SOFR + 2.25%**.
        * The **Term Loan** bears **Term SOFR + 1.80%**. 
Both instruments reflect variable rates that can impact cash flow when interest rates fluctuate.

By understanding the balance between fixed and variable interest rates, investors can assess how changes in market conditions may affect the REIT's debt service costs and overall profitability. This evaluation is critical for anticipating future cash flow requirements and maintaining financial health.

## Key Debt Metrics and Covenants

In evaluating a REIT's debt health, several key variables are used to gauge financial stability and risk. These metrics provide insights into how effectively a REIT generates income to cover its debt obligations and manage leverage. For example, the **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)** measures whether operating income is sufficient for debt payments, while the **Net Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio** indicates overall leverage relative to earnings. The **Debt Yield** and **Cash Flow-to-Debt Ratio** assess the efficiency of income generation from the debt, and the **Adjusted Debt-to-Equity Ratio** reflects the balance between debt and shareholder equity. 


### Important Debt Variables of FrontView REIT (FVR)

Using FVR as an example with third-quarter 2024 data, the table below outlines these important metrics:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Metric</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Value for FrontView REIT </strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Explanation</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
   </td>
   <td>0.78×
   </td>
   <td>Indicates that the REIT’s operating income covers only 78% of its required debt service. 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

   <td>0.0365
   </td>
   <td>This ratio means that for every $1 of debt, the REIT generates only $0.0365 in operating cash flow.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Adjusted Debt-to-Equity Ratio
   </td>
   <td>1.47
   </td>
   <td>Indicates that the REIT’s debt is 1.47 times its equity.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


There are many more metrics that can be taken into account when evaluating a REIT's overall debt health and financial stability.


### Covenant and Its Implications 

**Covenants** are legally binding promises or requirements included in loan agreements to protect lenders by ensuring the borrower maintains a certain level of financial health or follows specified operational guidelines. These requirements can be **financial** (e.g., maintaining a minimum debt service coverage ratio or maximum leverage ratio) or **operational** (e.g., restrictions on selling assets without lender approval). If a covenant is breached—such as when a REIT’s net operating income drops below a threshold needed to meet a required coverage ratio—the lender can declare a default, demand immediate repayment, increase interest rates, or impose other penalties.

Below is an overview of the **financial covenants** and **reporting requirements** that FVR expects to follow under its New Revolving Credit Facility and New Delayed Draw Term Loan. These covenants help ensure that the REIT maintains prudent leverage, adequate coverage of its debt obligations, and a sufficient equity base. A breach of any covenant (or event of default) could restrict the REIT from paying dividends in excess of those required to maintain its REIT status.



1. **Total Leverage Ratio (≤60%)**
* This ratio compares the REIT’s total debt to its total assets (or total capitalization). Keeping it at or below 60% helps limit over-leverage.
* FVR’s current figure stands at **30.9%**, indicating that its total leverage is well within the allowed threshold.
2. **Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges Ratio (≥1.50 to 1.00)**
* Measures how many times the REIT’s earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) cover its fixed charges (such as interest expense).
* FVR’s ratio is **2.3×**, showing that the REIT’s earnings can comfortably cover its fixed debt-related expenses.

## Why Look for Convertible Preferred Shares in a REIT’s Debt Structure?

As an investor, it’s important to check if a REIT has **convertible preferred shares** in its **debt structure**.

These shares combine features of both **debt** and **equity**. On one hand, they often pay a **fixed dividend** and have a higher **claim on assets** than common shares. On the other hand, they can be **converted** into common shares, which may **dilute** the value of existing shares. 

By looking at whether a REIT uses convertible preferred shares and understanding their specific terms, investors can better judge the **risks**, **possible dilution**, and **overall cost of capital** for the REIT.


### Real-World Example from FVR

On **July 9, 2021**, FVR (through NADG NNN Operating LP) admitted **convertible preferred unit holders** who own **Series A preferred units**. These units pay a quarterly distribution equal to the greater of **6.25% per year** or the yield on FVR’s common units. After a **30-month hold period**, the preferred holders can either **redeem** their units—subject to the partnership’s extension rights—or **convert** them into common units if a **liquidation event** (such as an IPO) takes place.

## Conclusion

A thorough look at FVR’s **debt structure**—covering instruments like **Asset Backed Securities**, **revolving credit facilities**, **term loans**, and **convertible preferred shares**—highlights how each piece affects the REIT’s **financial stability**. Understanding key metrics such as the **Debt Service Coverage Ratio**, **Net Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio**, and **Weighted Average Interest Rate** provides insight into **leverage** and **cash flow** demands. Meanwhile, **covenants** serve as guardrails to ensure prudent borrowing practices, and **convertible preferred shares** add both a fixed return and the possibility of equity conversion. By examining these elements together, investors can form a more complete view of the REIT’s ability to **manage its obligations**, **support ongoing operations**, and **deliver long-term value**.
