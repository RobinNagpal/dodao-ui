## 2.1. **Dividend Discount Model (DDM)**

### 2.1.1. **Detailed Explanation**

- **Core Concept:** The DDM values a stock by summing the present value of all future expected dividend payments. It assumes that a company’s intrinsic worth is determined by the stream of cash dividends it can pay to shareholders.

- **Key Historical Contributor:** John Burr Williams (1938) first outlined the dividend-based approach in *The Theory of Investment Value*. Later, Myron J. Gordon (1959) refined it into the **Gordon Growth Model**.

- **Key Assumptions:**
  1. The company **pays dividends consistently** (or will pay in the future).
  2. There is a **constant or predictable growth rate** in those dividends.
  3. The **required return on equity** (discount rate) is known and remains stable over time.

- **Variations:**
  - **Gordon Growth Model** (constant growth):

    \[
    P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - g}
    \]

    where \(P_0\) is the current price, \(D_1\) is the next dividend, \(r\) is the required rate of return, and \(g\) is the constant growth rate.
  - **Multi-stage DDM** (if growth rates change over different periods).

### 2.1.2. **Expanded Example**

Suppose you have a **mature utility** company known for reliable dividends:
  - Last dividend paid (\(D_0\)): \$2.00 per share
  - Annual dividend growth rate (\(g\)): 3%
  - Required rate of return (\(r\)): 8%

**Steps:**

1. **Forecast the next dividend**

  \[
  D_1 = D_0 \times (1 + g) = 2.00 \times 1.03 = \$2.06
  \]


2. **Apply the constant-growth DDM formula**

  \[
  P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - g} = \frac{2.06}{0.08 - 0.03} = \frac{2.06}{0.05} = \$41.20
  \]

3. **Interpretation**
  If you assume **3% annual dividend growth forever** and require an **8% annual return**, then \$41.20 per share is the intrinsic value implied by the model.

## 2.2. **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)**

### 2.2.1. **Detailed Explanation**

- **Core Concept:** FCFE represents the **cash flow available** to equity shareholders after covering all **operational expenses, taxes, capital expenditures, changes in working capital, and net debt transactions**.

- **Key Historical Context:**: While there isn’t a single “inventor,” the **discounted cash flow approach** (from which FCFE is derived) traces back to **Irving Fisher (1930)** and was further developed in corporate finance literature, notably refined by **Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani (1958)**.

- **Why It Matters:** It’s useful for **firms without stable dividends**, focusing on **potential** or **actual** free cash flows rather than declared dividends.

- **Key Inputs:**
  - Net income (or EBIT/EBITDA as a starting point, then adjust).
  - Non-cash charges (depreciation, amortization).
  - Changes in working capital.
  - Capital expenditures (CapEx).
  - Net debt issued or repaid.

### 2.2.2. **Expanded Example**

Imagine **Company B**, a fast-growing tech firm paying **no dividends**, but you want to estimate its equity value.

1. **Given Data:**
    - Net Income = \$500 million
    - Depreciation = \$150 million
    - Capital Expenditures = \$200 million
    - Change in Working Capital = +\$50 million (a cash outflow)
    - Net Debt Issued = +\$100 million

2. **Calculate FCFE:**

  \[
  \text{FCFE}
  = \text{Net Income}
    + \text{Depreciation}
    - \text{CapEx}
    - \Delta \text{Working Capital}
    + \text{Net Debt}
  \]
  \[
  = 500 + 150 - 200 - 50 + 100
  = \$500\text{ million}
  \]

3. **Convert to Per-Share Basis:**
If the firm has 100 million shares:

\[
\text{FCFE per share} = \frac{500\text{ million}}{100\text{ million shares}} = \$5
\]

4. **Valuation (Constant-Growth Approach):**
    - Long-term FCFE growth (\(g\)) = 4%
    - Cost of equity (\(r\)) = 10%
    - Next year’s FCFE per share = \$5 × (1.04) = \$5.20

\[
P_0 = \frac{5.20}{0.10 - 0.04}
= \frac{5.20}{0.06}
\approx \$86.67
\]

5. **Interpretation**
The model suggests a per-share equity value of ~\$86.67, **assuming** a 4% growth in FCFE and a 10% cost of equity.

## 2.3. **Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)**

### 2.3.1. **Detailed Explanation**

- **Core Concept:**
FCFF looks at the total operating cash flow available to **all** providers of capital (both debt and equity).

- **Historical Context:**
Also rooted in the broader discounted cash flow approach. Its modern usage in valuation was heavily popularized by authors like **Aswath Damodaran (1990s)** and in **CFA Institute** materials.

- **Why It Matters:**
Often used for **M&A** or when you want a valuation approach **independent of capital structure**. After you discount FCFF at the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), you can subtract net debt to get the equity value.

### 2.3.2. **Expanded Example**

Assume you’re evaluating **Company C**, a manufacturing firm:

1. **Given Data:**
    - EBIT = \$800 million
    - Tax rate = 30%
    - Depreciation = \$200 million
    - CapEx = \$300 million
    - Change in Working Capital = +\$100 million (outflow)
    - WACC = 9%
    - Long-term growth = 3%

2. **Compute After-Tax EBIT:**

\[
\text{EBIT} \times (1 - \text{Tax})
= 800 \times (1 - 0.30)
= 800 \times 0.70
= \$560\text{ million}
\]

3. **Compute FCFF:**

\[
\text{FCFF}
= \text{EBIT}(1 - \text{Tax})
  + \text{Depreciation}
  - \text{CapEx}
  - \Delta \text{Working Capital}
\]
\[
= 560 + 200 - 300 - 100
= \$360\text{ million}
\]

4. **Terminal Value (Perpetual Growth):**

\[
\text{TV}
= \frac{\text{FCFF} \times (1 + g)}{\text{WACC} - g}
= \frac{360 \times 1.03}{0.09 - 0.03}
= \frac{370.8}{0.06}
= \$6.18\text{ billion}
\]

5. **Equity Value (Simplified):**
    - Present value of near-term FCFF + terminal value ≈ \$6.18 billion (assumed).
    - If total debt = \$2 billion, then equity value ≈ \$6.18 billion − \$2 billion = \$4.18 billion.

6. **Interpretation**
By focusing on **all** operating cash flows and discounting at the **WACC**, you get an **enterprise** value. Subtracting debt then yields the implied **equity** value.

## 2.4. **Residual Income Model (RIM)**

### 2.4.1. **Detailed Explanation**

- **Core Concept:**
Also called the **Economic Profit** approach. It starts with the firm’s **book value of equity** and adds the present value of “residual income”—the portion of net income that **exceeds** the required return on the beginning book value of equity.

- **Historical Contributor:**
The modern formulation is frequently linked to **James Ohlson (1995)** and the Ohlson model. It highlights the difference between **accounting returns** (ROE) and the **cost of equity**.

- **When to Use:**
It is especially helpful when a firm’s **free cash flow is erratic** but accounting earnings and book values are more predictable.

### 2.4.2. **Expanded Example**

Consider **Company D**, a bank:

1. **Given Data:**
    - Book Value of Equity (\(B_0\)) = \$1 billion
    - Net Income = \$150 million
    - Required Return on Equity (\(r\)) = 10%
    - Long-term growth of residual income = 4%

2. **Calculate Required Income:**
\[
\text{Required Income}
= r \times B_0
= 0.10 \times \$1\text{ billion}
= \$100\text{ million}
\]

3. **Residual Income (RI):**
\[
\text{RI} = \text{Net Income} - \text{Required Income}
= 150 - 100
= \$50\text{ million}
\]

4. **Capitalizing the Residual Income:**
\[
\text{PV}(\text{RI})
= \frac{\text{RI}}{r - g}
= \frac{50}{0.10 - 0.04}
= \frac{50}{0.06}
= \$833\text{ million}
\]

5. **Total Equity Value:**
\[
V_0
= B_0 + \text{PV of Future RI}
= 1,000 + 833
= \$1.83\text{ billion}
\]

6. **Interpretation**
Even if short-term cash flows fluctuate, **residual income** can reveal how much profit is earned **above the cost of equity**. This yields an approximate equity value of \$1.83 billion.

## 2.5. **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**

### 2.5.1. **Detailed Explanation**

- **Core Concept:**
CAPM **is not** a direct valuation model. Instead, it estimates the **required return on equity**—often used as the **discount rate** in DDM, FCFE, or FCFF models.

- **Historical Contributors:**
**William F. Sharpe (1964)**, **John Lintner (1965)**, and **Jan Mossin (1966)** built on **Harry Markowitz’s** portfolio theory (1952).

- **Underlying Logic:**
Investors expect a premium over the risk-free rate for taking on systematic (market) risk. That premium is scaled by the firm’s **beta**, which measures the firm’s volatility relative to the overall market.

- **Formula:**
\[
r_e = R_f + \beta (R_m - R_f)
\]

### 2.5.2. **Expanded Example**

A large consumer staples firm:

- Risk-Free Rate (\(R_f\)) = 4%
- Market Risk Premium (\(R_m - R_f\)) = 6%
- Beta (\(\beta\)) = 1.2

\[
r_e
= 0.04 + 1.2 \times 0.06
= 0.04 + 0.072
= 0.112
= 11.2\%
\]

**Interpretation**
You would use **11.2%** as the **required return on equity** when discounting this firm’s future cash flows or dividends.

## 2.6. **Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio**

### 2.6.1. **Detailed Explanation**

- **Core Concept:**
The **P/E ratio** is a straightforward, **relative** valuation multiple that indicates how much investors are willing to pay for **each dollar of current earnings**.

- **Historical Popularization:**
Widely used since **Benjamin Graham and David Dodd (1934)** emphasized earnings-based valuation in *Security Analysis*.

- **Use Cases:**
    - **Quick screening** to see if a stock is “cheap” or “expensive” relative to peers.
    - Works best for **stable, profitable companies** where EPS is a consistent measure.

- **Limitations:**
    - Does **not** capture **growth** prospects directly.
    - One-time charges or cyclical swings in earnings can distort the ratio.

### 2.6.2. **Expanded Example**

A stable industrial firm:

  - Current Stock Price = \$90
  - EPS = \$6

\[
P/E
= \frac{90}{6}
= 15
\]

If its major competitors trade at an average P/E of 18, this firm **might** be undervalued—assuming comparable growth and risk.

---

## 2.7. **PEG Ratio (P/E to Growth)**

### 2.7.1. **Detailed Explanation**

- **Core Concept:**
The PEG ratio adds a **growth dimension** to the P/E ratio, dividing P/E by the expected annual **EPS growth rate**.

- **Historical Popularization:**
Often linked to **Peter Lynch (1989)** in his book *One Up on Wall Street*.

- **Interpretation:**
    - **PEG = 1** → P/E aligns with its growth rate.
    - **PEG < 1** → Potentially “undervalued” relative to growth.
    - **PEG > 1** → Potentially “overvalued” relative to growth.

- **Caveat:**
A **small error** in growth projections can significantly skew the ratio.

### 2.7.2. **Expanded Example**

Consider a **growth-focused** consumer discretionary firm:

- P/E = 30
- Projected EPS Growth = 20%

\[
\text{PEG}
= \frac{30}{20}
= 1.5
\]

A PEG of 1.5 suggests the stock’s **P/E is higher** than its **growth rate**, which could imply a premium valuation.

---

## 2.8. **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**

### 2.8.1. **Detailed Explanation**

- **Core Concept:**
**P/B** compares the **market value of equity** (market cap) to the **book value of equity**. It is especially relevant for **financial institutions** or asset-heavy sectors.

- **Earliest Influence:**
Benjamin Graham (1934) also explored **book value** as a protective margin in stock investing.

- **Use Cases:**
    - **Banks and insurance** companies, where assets and liabilities are close to market values.
    - Asset-heavy sectors (e.g., **real estate**, **materials**), where physical assets are large.

- **Limitations:**
    - Book value can be misleading for companies with significant **intangible** assets (e.g., tech, brand value).

### 2.8.2. **Expanded Example**

A regional bank:

- Market Cap = \$1.2 billion
- Book Value of Equity = \$1.0 billion

\[
P/B
= \frac{1.2B}{1.0B}
= 1.2
\]

If peer banks trade at **1.0×**, this **1.2×** ratio suggests a **premium**—possibly justified by higher ROE or superior credit quality.

---

## 2.9. **Earnings Yield (Inverse of P/E)**

### 2.9.1. **Detailed Explanation**

- **Core Concept:**
**Earnings Yield** = EPS / Price. It is the **reciprocal** of the P/E ratio and lets investors compare equity returns to bond yields.

- **Historical Usage:**
Also traced back to fundamental analysts like **Benjamin Graham** who compared corporate earnings yields to bond rates.

- **Why It’s Helpful:**
If a stock’s earnings yield is **above** comparable bond yields, some consider it more attractive—assuming those earnings are sustained.

- **Limitations:**
- Like P/E, one-year EPS might not be sustainable if earnings are **cyclical** or **distorted** by unusual items.

### 2.9.2. **Expanded Example**

A consumer staples firm with **consistent profits**:

- EPS = \$5
- Current Price = \$100

\[
\text{Earnings Yield}
= \frac{5}{100}
= 5\%
\]

If the 10-year Treasury yield is around **4%**, the stock’s 5% earnings yield **may** look attractive—provided the company’s earnings remain stable or grow.

## 2.10. **Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)**

### 2.10.1. **Detailed Explanation**

- **Core Concept:**
**EV/EBITDA** is a **capital-structure-neutral** multiple. Enterprise Value (EV) is market cap + total debt − cash, while EBITDA approximates operating cash flow before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

- **Historical Popularity:**
Gained traction among practitioners and in leveraged buyout (LBO) analyses in the **1980s**. Further expounded in the works of **McKinsey & Company** and other financial texts.

- **Use Cases:**
    - Very common in **M&A** comparisons.
    - Helps compare companies with different **debt levels** or in capital-intensive industries.

- **Caveats:**
  - **Ignores capital expenditures**. A firm with high ongoing CapEx might look cheap on EV/EBITDA even though free cash flow is low.

### 2.10.2. **Expanded Example**

A private equity target:

- EV = \$2 billion (equity + net debt)
- EBITDA = \$250 million

\[
\text{EV/EBITDA}
= \frac{2,000}{250}
= 8
\]

If peers trade at **10× EBITDA**, you might initially see this as an undervaluation, though **operational risks** or **CapEx** requirements could explain the discrepancy.

# 3. **Sector-by-Sector Analysis (GICS)**

GICS has **11 main sectors**, each with unique **financial** and **operational** nuances. Below are guidelines on:

1. **Four recommended models** for each sector.
2. **Three least recommended models** for that sector (and why).

---

## 3.1. **Energy**

- **Examples:** ExxonMobil, Chevron
- **Characteristics:** Capital-intensive, revenues fluctuate with commodity prices, big players often pay stable dividends.

**4 Recommended Models**
1. **FCFF** – Suited to capital-intensive operations.
2. **EV/EBITDA** – Widely used; neutralizes debt-level differences.
3. **P/B** – Tangible asset bases can be material (reserves).
4. **DDM** – Some integrated majors pay significant dividends.

**3 Not Recommended & Why**
1. **PEG** – Commodity-driven revenue swings make growth estimates tough.
2. **RIM** – Book values and earnings can fluctuate with commodity cycles.
3. **Earnings Yield** – Single-year EPS can be **too cyclical**.

---

## 3.2. **Materials**

- **Examples:** Dow, DuPont, Newmont
- **Characteristics:** Asset-heavy (mining, chemicals), cyclical with commodity pricing.

**4 Recommended Models**
1. **FCFF** – Overall enterprise view for capital-intensive firms.
2. **EV/EBITDA** – Standard multiple in mining/chemicals.
3. **P/B** – Useful when tangible assets are critical (e.g., mineral reserves).
4. **RIM** – If stable book values and profitability exist.

**3 Not Recommended & Why**
1. **DDM** – Inconsistent dividend policies.
2. **PEG** – Volatile commodity-driven earnings hamper stable growth forecasts.
3. **Earnings Yield** – Single-year earnings can misrepresent long-term value.

---

## 3.3. **Industrials**

- **Examples:** GE, Caterpillar, Boeing
- **Characteristics:** Broad cyclical sector; many large companies with significant capex and varied product lines.

**4 Recommended Models**
1. **FCFF** – Captures enterprise value for cyclical, capex-heavy firms.
2. **EV/EBITDA** – Very common for peer comparisons.
3. **PEG** – Useful for segments with a steady growth narrative (e.g., aerospace).
4. **P/E** – Standard gauge for mature industrial firms.

**3 Not Recommended & Why**
1. **DDM** – Dividends often aren’t the primary focus.
2. **RIM** – Product-line complexity can undermine residual income assumptions.
3. **P/B** – Intangibles and diversified operations make book value less meaningful.

---

## 3.4. **Consumer Discretionary**

- **Examples:** Tesla, Nike, Amazon
- **Characteristics:** Often higher-growth, brand-driven, or cyclical consumer spending.

**4 Recommended Models**
1. **FCFE** – Many of these firms reinvest heavily; dividends are rare.
2. **PEG** – Growth-oriented sector.
3. **P/E** – Still a universal benchmark.
4. **EV/EBITDA** – Good for retailers, restaurants, e-commerce with varying debt levels.

**3 Not Recommended & Why**
1. **DDM** – Companies typically do not pay big, stable dividends.
2. **P/B** – Intangible brand value is huge, book value underrepresents it.
3. **RIM** – Earnings can be unpredictable; intangible-driven.

---

## 3.5. **Consumer Staples**

- **Examples:** Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Walmart
- **Characteristics:** Stable demand, dependable cash flow, many pay consistent dividends.

**4 Recommended Models**
1. **DDM** – Frequent, reliable dividend payouts.
2. **FCFF** – Stable, predictable cash flows.
3. **P/E** – Common benchmark for day-to-day comparisons.
4. **Earnings Yield** – Often compared to bond-like yields (defensive stocks).

**3 Not Recommended & Why**
1. **PEG** – Growth is modest; a growth-based ratio is less revealing.
2. **RIM** – Standard DCF or dividend models typically suffice.
3. **P/B** – Intangibles and brand values overshadow raw book value.

---

## 3.6. **Health Care**

- **Examples:** Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Biotech Startups
- **Characteristics:** Includes stable pharma, large health care providers, and high-risk biotech with uncertain cash flows.

**4 Recommended Models**
1. **FCFE** – Good for firms that don’t pay dividends but generate equity cash flow.
2. **PEG** – For high-growth biotech or pharma.
3. **RIM** – Established pharma can have steadier book values/earnings.
4. **EV/EBITDA** – Common for large health care conglomerates.

**3 Not Recommended & Why**
1. **DDM** – Early-stage biotech rarely pays dividends, and even big pharma’s dividends might not be the central valuation factor.
2. **P/B** – R&D-based intangible assets overshadow book value.
3. **Earnings Yield** – Pipeline successes/failures can skew earnings in a single year.

---

## 3.7. **Financials**

- **Examples:** JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Berkshire Hathaway, Visa
- **Characteristics:** Highly regulated, unique treatment of **debt vs. deposits**, intangible drivers in some subsectors (like payments).

**4 Recommended Models**
1. **P/B** – Regulatory capital and book equity are central.
2. **RIM** – Highlights how ROE compares to cost of equity.
3. **P/E** – Common for banks, insurers, and payment companies.
4. **Earnings Yield** – Can compare yield to bond markets (a rough approach).

**3 Not Recommended & Why**
1. **FCFF** – Complex for banks; interest expense is part of core operations, and deposit-based funding complicates standard corporate FCFF.
2. **PEG** – Growth is overshadowed by interest rate cycles, regulation, and credit risk.
3. **EV/EBITDA** – EBITDA is less meaningful in financials, where “interest” is part of revenue, not an expense to add back.

---

## 3.8. **Information Technology**

- **Examples:** Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Salesforce
- **Characteristics:** Often asset-light, intangible-driven, can be very high growth.

**4 Recommended Models**
1. **FCFE** – Captures equity returns for R&D-intensive firms that rarely pay dividends.
2. **PEG** – Growth potential is crucial in tech.
3. **EV/EBITDA** – Standard peer comparison for software/hardware.
4. **P/E** – Mature tech with stable earnings often references this.

**3 Not Recommended & Why**
1. **DDM** – Dividends are small or non-existent for many high-growth techs.
2. **P/B** – Book value rarely captures intangible IP or brand.
3. **RIM** – Accounting complexities (equity compensation, intangible R&D) complicate residual calculations.

---

## 3.9. **Communication Services**

- **Examples:** Alphabet (Google), Meta, Verizon, Disney
- **Characteristics:** Telecom (stable dividends, heavy capex) + digital media (high growth, intangible assets).

**4 Recommended Models**
1. **FCFF** – Good for large-scale telecom or media conglomerates.
2. **PEG** – Applied to fast-growing digital ad/streaming businesses.
3. **EV/EBITDA** – Common for telecom M&A/peer comps.
4. **P/E** – Established telecom or media companies often use this.

**3 Not Recommended & Why**
1. **DDM** – Not all pay big, predictable dividends (especially the digital giants).
2. **P/B** – High intangible content (content libraries, brand, IP).
3. **RIM** – Residual income is less standard when intangible assets drive growth.

---

## 3.10. **Utilities**

- **Examples:** Duke Energy, NextEra Energy
- **Characteristics:** Regulated, steady cash flows, large infrastructure investments, notable dividends.

**4 Recommended Models**
1. **DDM** – Dividends are a major reason to hold utilities.
2. **FCFF** – Reflects large infrastructure spending, stable demand.
3. **EV/EBITDA** – Peer comparisons in regulated markets.
4. **Earnings Yield** – Often compared to bond yields.

**3 Not Recommended & Why**
1. **PEG** – Growth is minimal; regulated environment caps it.
2. **RIM** – Regulated returns on equity reduce the need for a residual approach.
3. **FCFE** – Frequent debt/equity issuance for infrastructure can complicate equity-specific cash flow.

---

## 3.11. **Real Estate (including REITs)**

- **Examples:** Simon Property Group, Prologis
- **Characteristics:** Asset-backed revenue streams, high dividend payouts (for REITs), property values are central.

**4 Recommended Models**
1. **P/B** – Reflects net asset value (NAV) of property holdings.
2. **FCFE** – REITs revolve around funds distributable to equity holders.
3. **EV/EBITDA** – Useful for property owners/operators to compare operational results.
4. **DDM** – REIT rules require high payout ratios, so dividends are a big factor.

**3 Not Recommended & Why**
1. **PEG** – Real estate “growth” depends heavily on occupancy, rent, and acquisitions, not typical EPS expansions.
2. **RIM** – Book value restatements from property revaluations complicate residual income.
3. **Earnings Yield** – REIT-specific metrics like **Funds From Operations (FFO)** often replace standard EPS.

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Energy**                 | PEG, RIM, Earnings Yield             | Cyclical earnings, volatile book values, single-year EPS not reflective of true cash flows      |
| **Materials**              | DDM, PEG, Earnings Yield             | Inconsistent dividends, cyclical growth, short-term earnings swings                             |
| **Industrials**            | DDM, RIM, P/B                        | Often reinvest heavily, complex accounting, intangible brand/tech overshadowing book value      |
| **Consumer Discretionary** | DDM, P/B, RIM                        | Dividends often small, intangible brand, earnings volatility                                    |
| **Consumer Staples**       | PEG, RIM, P/B                        | Slower growth, stable dividends/cash make DCF or DDM more relevant, brand intangible vs. book   |
| **Health Care**            | DDM, P/B, Earnings Yield             | Biotech rarely pays dividends, intangible R&D, high EPS fluctuations                            |
| **Financials**             | FCFF, PEG, EV/EBITDA                 | Complex deposit vs. debt structure, overshadowed by regulation, EBITDA not typical              |
| **Information Technology** | DDM, P/B, RIM                        | Minimal dividends, intangible IP, accounting complexities for residual income                   |
| **Communication Services** | DDM, P/B, RIM                        | Not all pay stable dividends, intangible-driven content/IP, RIM overshadowed by intangible value |
| **Utilities**              | PEG, RIM, FCFE                       | Regulated low growth, RIM less relevant, frequent debt/equity issuance complicates FCFE         |
| **Real Estate**            | PEG, RIM, Earnings Yield             | Growth from rents/acquisitions, revaluation changes in book, FFO more relevant than EPS         |

# 5. **Closing Notes**

1. **No single model is perfect.**
Each model relies on assumptions about growth, discount rates, and accounting measures.

2. **Sector context is critical.**
Cyclical commodity-based firms differ greatly from intangible-driven tech companies.

3. **Combine intrinsic and relative methods.**
Most analysts use both a **DCF** approach (FCFF or FCFE) and a **multiple** approach (P/E, EV/EBITDA) to cross-check results.

4. **Sensitivity analysis is vital.**
Always see how valuation changes if **growth**, **discount rate**, or **margins** fluctuate.
