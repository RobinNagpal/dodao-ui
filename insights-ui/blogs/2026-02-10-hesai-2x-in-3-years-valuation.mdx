The automotive LiDAR market should still expand over the next 3 years because LiDAR is increasingly being packaged into higher-end ADAS (and in China, into cheaper models as unit costs fall), but growth will likely be “volume up, price per unit down,” which naturally pressures revenue-per-vehicle and margins. Investor interest looks **selective rather than euphoric**: Hesai’s stock has already rerated (EV/Sales 8.2 and trailing P/E 59), implying the market is paying up for a “scale winner,” not a cheap optionality bet. The company’s trajectory is genuinely improving (LTM operating income positive; net cash US$917m), but the quality of recent profits matters because a meaningful portion of Q3’25 net income was driven by “other income” from disposal of an equity investment. The single biggest reason **2× is hard** is that today’s valuation already prices in a big chunk of the “scale + margin expansion” story, while policy/geopolitical headline risk (including U.S. efforts to restrict Chinese LiDAR in vehicles) can cap multiples even if fundamentals execute.

## 1) PRIMARY framework / anchor: EV / Revenue (EV/Sales)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/Revenue is the best primary anchor because LiDAR is still in a scale-up phase where **design wins → unit volumes → revenue** are the cleanest “truth metric,” while EBITDA and FCF can swing with ramp costs, pricing resets, and one-offs. Today Hesai is valued at about **$4.08B market cap and $3.16B enterprise value**, with **EV/Sales 8.2** on **LTM revenue $386M** and **157M shares outstanding**; shares rose **7.7% YoY**, so per-share math matters. In listed LiDAR peers, EV/Sales spans “low single digits” (Innoviz 3.5) to “high single digits” (Ouster 7.5), so Hesai is already near the high end of the public comp set.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

“2× in 3 years” means 26% per year because 26% compounded for 3 years is 2×. For a stock like this, that return usually comes from some mix of revenue compounding (bigger numerator), a stable-or-higher EV/Sales multiple (same or bigger valuation wrapper), and not giving it back through dilution or cash burn.

Under an EV/Revenue lens, getting to 2× typically needs something like **2.0× revenue growth** over 3 years (about 26%/yr) _and_ a **roughly flat** EV/Sales multiple, because if the multiple falls from 8× to 5–6× as growth normalizes, that derating alone is a 0.6–0.75× headwind. Then you still must protect the equity from **per-share leakage** (dilution) and from **net-cash shrink** (if cash funds capex/ramp losses); those can easily subtract another 5–15% combined if things get messy.

The most realistic “history-shaped” growth path is still solid but not a straight line. Revenue has scaled sharply over time, but with meaningful investment and dilution: **Revenue: FY20 RMB416m → FY24 RMB2,077m; shares: 90m → 129m → 157m.** In the nearer term, Q3’25 revenue was RMB795m (+47% YoY) and Q4’25 guidance was RMB1,000–1,200m (+39% to +67% YoY), which supports the idea that unit volumes are ramping, but it does not guarantee that 30%+ revenue CAGR will persist once pricing steps down. A conservative 3-year revenue assumption for a “winner” in a fast-growing but price-competitive hardware segment is **20% to 30% per year** (≈ 1.73× to 2.20× over 3 years), with gross margin staying around the low-40s rather than expanding meaningfully (because OEM bargaining power and competitor catch-up tend to push LiDAR ASPs down).

Put plainly, **2× needs the high end** of that revenue outcome **and** a non-hostile multiple. If revenue lands nearer 1.7–1.9× and EV/Sales compresses even modestly (say 8× → 6×), the math looks more like 1.3× before dilution/cash effects, which is not a 2× setup. Net: fundamentals 1.73× to 2.20×; valuation 0.60× to 1.10×; per-share 0.85× to 0.98×; total 0.88× to 2.37×. **2× needs** revenue to track closer to 30%/yr while EV/Sales stays near today’s high-single-digit level and dilution slows versus the last year.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

Starting point: EV/Sales 8.2 on LTM revenue $386M, with enterprise value $3.16B and net cash around $917M (a real cushion, but not “infinite” if capex and overseas expansion ramp). If revenue compounds 20–30% per year, that’s 1.73× to 2.20× over 3 years; the low end matches “good adoption, but ASP pressure,” while the high end requires both rising unit penetration and continued global wins (for example, the Mercedes sourcing headline is directionally supportive for market expansion beyond China).

On valuation, the “most conservative” expectation is **some derating** as the story matures: EV/Sales drifting from 8× toward 6–7× is plausible if growth slows or geopolitical risk re-prices the whole China ADR complex; the optimistic case is holding 8–9× if Hesai proves it can be the cost leader at scale. On per-share effects, the stock has diluted 7.7% YoY; with net cash $917M, dilution could slow, but assuming **2–5% annual dilution** (≈ 0.86× to 0.94× over 3 years) is still conservative for a hardware scaler. Putting it together, a reasonable EV/Revenue base case looks like **1.4× to 1.9×**, with a wider plausible range **0.9× to 2.4×** because both the multiple and dilution rate can swing quickly for this stock.

## 2) CROSS-CHECK framework / anchor #1: EV / EBITDA

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

EV/EBITDA is a useful cross-check because the long-run investment thesis ultimately must become “hardware scale → manufacturing efficiency → operating leverage,” not just revenue growth. Right now the market is already pricing in that future: Hesai trades around **EV/EBITDA 66** (and EV/EBIT 130), which is extremely rich versus most auto suppliers and even rich versus many growth hardware names, meaning the stock is **already valued like EBITDA will be much larger soon**. LTM EBITDA is only about **$48M** on **$386M revenue** (≈ 12% EBITDA margin), and that margin can be volatile in a ramping, price-resetting market.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× price in 3 years still means 26%/yr, but under EV/EBITDA the hurdle is harsher because **the starting multiple is very high**. When a stock is at 66× EBITDA, you typically don’t get “multiple expansion” as your friend; you usually assume **multiple compression** as the business matures and EBITDA becomes less “option-like.”

To get to 2× while the multiple compresses, EBITDA must grow much faster than the share price. For example, if EV/EBITDA falls from 66× to 30× (not crazy if the market starts treating it like a scaling component supplier rather than a scarce-growth asset), that’s a 0.45× valuation multiplier, so you’d need roughly **4.4× EBITDA growth** to still hit 2× (because 4.4× × 0.45× ≈ 2×), before dilution/cash effects.

A realistic EBITDA build for 3 years is “margin improvement, but not unlimited.” Gross margin is around 41%, and LTM operating income is positive, so operating leverage is starting to show; however, OEM price pressure and continued R&D/engineering to win platforms usually prevent a straight march to 20%+ EBITDA margins. A conservative path is revenue 1.7× to 2.2× (as above) and EBITDA margin drifting from 12% toward **10–15%** rather than exploding; that yields EBITDA growth more like **1.4× to 2.8×**, not 4×+. The “can realistically go wrong” version is a pricing step-down that holds EBITDA margin flat or lower even as units rise.

So the gap is that **2× needs an EBITDA step-change** that’s above what today’s hardware economics usually allow, especially once you assume multiple compression. Net: fundamentals (EBITDA) 1.4× to 2.8×; valuation 0.35× to 0.65×; per-share 0.85× to 0.98×; total 0.42× to 1.79×. **2× needs** something like “EBITDA 3.5–5× _and_ EV/EBITDA stays well above 30×,” which is a higher bar than the revenue-multiple anchor.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

Baseline: EV $3.16B and LTM EBITDA $47.7M imply 66× EV/EBITDA, which is the valuation of a business the market expects to scale rapidly and profitably. If EBITDA grows 2× over 3 years (for example, revenue 2× and EBITDA margin stays roughly similar), EV could still rise, but if the multiple compresses to 30–40×, EV growth is muted: 2× EBITDA × 0.45–0.60× multiple ≈ 0.9× to 1.2× EV. That’s why EV/EBITDA often says “the stock can go sideways even while the business improves” when you start from a very high multiple.

Per-share, net cash ($917M) helps protect downside if profitability stays real, but it can also shrink if Hesai spends aggressively on overseas capacity or pricing wars; plus, shares already rose 7.7% YoY, so even “good EBITDA growth” can dilute into less impressive per-share outcomes. Under this anchor, a conservative expectation is **1.1× to 1.6×** over 3 years, with a plausible range **0.6× to 2.0×** (2.0× being a “near-best-case” where EBITDA ramps hard _and_ the market keeps assigning a very high multiple).

## 3) CROSS-CHECK framework / anchor #2: P/E (earnings multiple)

### A) Anchor selection + baseline

P/E is the right third lens because Hesai is now being **priced like an earnings story** (trailing P/E 59, forward P/E 41), and earnings-multiple stocks are extremely sensitive to “profit quality” and macro/policy risk premia. Here the key complication is that recent profitability includes meaningful non-operating “other income” (Q3’25 noted other income driven by disposal of an equity investment), which can make EPS look better than the underlying run-rate from selling LiDAR units.

### B) 2× hurdle vs likely path

A 2× in 3 years still means 26%/yr, but with a high starting P/E, the market is implicitly assuming earnings will grow fast _and_ that the company will deserve a premium multiple as it scales. In many hardware scale-ups, what happens instead is: earnings rise, but the P/E falls as the story de-risks and growth slows.

To reach 2× on a P/E framework, you need (earnings per share growth) × (P/E change) × (share count effect) to multiply to 2×. If the forward P/E drifts from 41 down to 25–30 as the company becomes “less scarce” and policy risk stays on the table, that’s a 0.6–0.75× valuation multiplier, which means EPS must rise 2.7× to 3.3× just to get to 2× price before dilution.

The “likely EPS” path should be treated cautiously because LTM net income ($60M) and margins are still early, and earnings quality can be noisy when other income is meaningful. A conservative view is that true operating earnings (not one-offs) grow more like **15–35% per year** once pricing pressure and R&D needs are accounted for, which is about **1.5× to 2.5×** over 3 years. The downside case is that policy risk or OEM pricing resets keep margins from expanding even if units grow.

That implies the arithmetic for 2× is strained: you’d need EPS growth toward the top end (or above it) _and_ you need the market to not compress the multiple much. Net: fundamentals (EPS) 1.5× to 2.5×; valuation 0.50× to 0.90×; per-share 0.85× to 0.98×; total 0.64× to 2.20×. **2× needs** “clean, repeatable operating EPS” and a policy backdrop that allows a premium P/E to persist.

### C) Outcome under this anchor

Baseline: P/E 59 on LTM EPS $0.44 and forward P/E 41 tells you the market is already looking through to higher earnings. If EPS doubles over 3 years (about 26%/yr), that alone would be great fundamentally, but if the P/E compresses from 41 to 25–30, price math becomes 2× × 0.6–0.75× ≈ 1.2× to 1.5× before dilution—solid, but not 2×.

What moves this anchor is risk premium: headlines about restricting Chinese LiDAR in vehicles (or a renewed national-security narrative) can keep the multiple capped even if the company executes, while a clear path to broad non-China adoption could support a higher “quality multiple.” With ongoing dilution risk, the most defensible P/E-based expectation is **1.2× to 1.6×**, with a plausible range **0.7× to 2.2×** (the high end requiring sustained, clean EPS compounding and only mild derating).

---

## 4) Final conclusion

Triangulating the three anchors, the **most likely** 3-year outcome for HSAI looks like **1.5× (range 0.8×–2.2×)**, where fundamentals do most of the work (revenue/earnings rising), valuation is a mild headwind or at best neutral (because multiples are already high), and per-share effects shave returns unless dilution slows meaningfully. My simple decomposition for the midpoint is: fundamentals 1.9×, valuation 0.8×, per-share 0.95×, giving 1.4–1.5× overall. The **2× verdict is: Borderline**—achievable, but it likely requires (1) revenue compounding closer to 30%/yr _and_ (2) EV/Sales staying near today’s high-single-digit level while dilution cools, and policy/geopolitical risk does not force a lower multiple. The single biggest swing factor is whether Hesai can prove **repeatable, operating-driven profitability** (not one-off “other income”) while scaling globally, because that is what earns a durable premium multiple.
