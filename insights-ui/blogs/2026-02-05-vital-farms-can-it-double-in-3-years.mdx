## A) Anchor Selection

The primary anchor for valuing Vital Farms is the Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) multiple. This metric is the most effective tool for this business because Vital Farms is a high-growth consumer packaged goods (CPG) company that requires significant depreciation and amortization (D&A) to account for its investment in processing facilities, such as its "Egg Central Station." By using EBITDA, we neutralize the non-cash impact of these capital-intensive investments and get a clearer view of the core operational cash-generating power. Other anchors like the P/E ratio can be distorted by the company’s fluctuating effective tax rates and the interest income generated from its substantial cash pile, which do not reflect the health of the underlying egg and butter business.

The first cross-check anchor is the Forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. While EV/EBITDA is better for operations, the P/E ratio is the most common shorthand used by the institutional and retail market to price mid-cap CPG stocks. It captures the "bottom line" reality that includes interest and taxes, which are essential for per-share outcomes. This anchor is particularly informative because it allows us to compare Vital Farms’ valuation against slower-growing commodity peers like Cal-Maine Foods and high-growth premium peers in the broader organic food space. It ensures that our primary valuation does not drift into an "operational vacuum" that ignores the actual net income available to shareholders.

The second cross-check anchor is Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield. This is a necessary check because Vital Farms operates an "asset-light" supply chain model but still faces significant working capital needs and periodic capacity expansion costs. FCF yield reveals whether the reported EBITDA is actually translating into spendable cash or if it is being consumed by inventory builds and the build-out of new processing lines. This anchor catches risks associated with capital intensity and ensures that the 3-year multiplier is supported by tangible cash generation rather than just accounting profits, which is vital for a company that must self-fund its growth to avoid shareholder dilution.

## B) The 3–4 Driver Framework

The first driver is Revenue Growth, fueled by both volume expansion and pricing stability. Vital Farms has historically grown revenue at a high rate, with a recent annual increase of ~28.5% in 2024. This growth is driven by increasing household penetration—moving from high-end specialty grocers into mainstream retailers—and the secular trend of consumers "trading up" to pasture-raised products. For our anchors, revenue growth is the "top-line engine" that dictates the scale of future EBITDA and EPS; without ~20% annual revenue growth, the stock likely lacks the momentum to reach a significant multiplier.

The second driver is Gross Margin Expansion, which is the company’s ability to maintain its premium $2 to $4 price gap over cage-free competitors while managing feed costs. Historically, the company has maintained gross margins in the 30% to 38% range, benefiting from its "Egg Central Station" scale which lowers processing costs per dozen. Margin expansion impacts the EV/EBITDA anchor by ensuring that every new dollar of revenue is more profitable than the last. If margins contract due to a spike in corn or soy feed costs (which are the primary inputs for their 300+ independent farms), the fundamental multiplier will stall even if revenue grows.

The third driver is Operating Leverage, specifically the ability to grow the business without a proportional increase in Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses. In recent years, Vital Farms has demonstrated that its brand equity allows it to spend more efficiently on marketing as it reaches national scale. If revenue grows at ~20% while SG&A grows at only ~15%, the "extra" 5% drops directly to the bottom line. This driver is the primary catalyst for expanding the EBITDA margin from the current ~12.6% toward a more mature CPG target of ~15-16%, which would significantly boost the per-share outcome.

The fourth driver is Share Count and Dilution. While Vital Farms is currently cash-rich, it uses stock-based compensation (SBC) to retain talent, which has historically caused a ~1% to ~4% annual creep in shares outstanding. Over a 3-year period, a ~10% total increase in shares (1.10x dilution) acts as a direct headwind to the per-share price multiplier. We must account for this because a doubling of the market cap does not equal a doubling of the stock price if the share count has expanded. Controlling this dilution is critical for the P/E and FCF-per-share anchors to reflect the company’s operational success.

## C) Baseline Snapshot

The current baseline for Vital Farms shows a company with strong momentum and a clean balance sheet. For the Fiscal Year 2024, the company recorded revenue of $606.3 million and EBITDA of $76.6 million, representing a ~12.6% EBITDA margin. On a per-share basis, the company earned $1.25 in net income. The balance sheet is a position of strength, ending the recent period with approximately

{/\*

> > > > > \*/}

56 million, resulting in a net cash position of roughly $89 million.

The 5-year trend indicates substantial scaling and improving unit economics. Revenue has grown from $214.3 million in 2020 to over $700 million on an LTM (last twelve months) basis, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 35%. More importantly, the business has transitioned from a low-margin early-stage firm (1.4% EBITDA margin in 2021) to a profitable mid-cap player. This trend implies that the business has reached a "tipping point" where its fixed costs are increasingly covered by its growing volume, and its premium brand is successfully defending against commodity price swings.

## D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”

Achieving a 2.0x stock price multiplier in 3 years requires a ~26% annual compound return. To reach this without a change in valuation multiples, the underlying per-share fundamentals (EBITDA, EPS, or FCF) must also double. This translates to growing the "bottom line" by approximately 100% over 3 years, or ~26% per year. If the company fails to grow fundamentals at this rate, a 2.0x return would require the market to pay a significantly higher multiple for each dollar of earnings, which is a risky assumption in a "similar regime" environment where interest rates and market risk appetites are stable.

For each anchor, the 2.0x "must-be-true" scenario is aggressive. For EV/EBITDA, if the current ~12x LTM multiple holds, EBITDA must grow from the current ~

{/\*

> > > > > gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it.
> > > > > \*/}

170M by year three. For the P/E anchor, with a current forward P/E of ~17x, the company would need to deliver ~$2.50 in EPS compared to the $1.25 baseline. For FCF, the company would need to move from erratic cash flows to a consistent ~8% FCF margin on much higher revenues. Essentially, 2.0x requires the company to maintain its high-growth "startup" velocity even as it reaches a billion-dollar revenue scale.

Based on company history, the most likely path is slightly more moderated. Vital Farms has shown it can grow revenue at 25-30%, but as the business matures and penetrates more of the U.S. market, a revenue CAGR of 18-22% is a more conservative and realistic expectation. Margins are likely to expand slightly as they optimize their distribution network, but they will face "law of large numbers" headwinds. History suggests that while the company is excellent at execution, doubling a $700M revenue base while doubling margins simultaneously is a feat rarely achieved in the competitive grocery aisle.

Industry logic suggests that Vital Farms is currently in the "sweet spot" of the premiumization trend, but competition is intensifying. Large commodity players are increasing their "cage-free" and "organic" capacity, which limits Vital Farms' ability to raise prices indefinitely. Furthermore, the capacity constraints of a pasture-raised supply chain—which requires 108 square feet per hen—mean that adding supply is slower and more expensive than for commodity producers. Consequently, a likely fundamental growth rate of 15-20% is more grounded in the reality of agricultural logistics than the 26%+ required for a 2.0x multiplier.

The gap between the "required" and "likely" outcomes is notable. To hit 2.0x, the company needs a "perfect" 3-year run: no avian flu outbreaks, no major spike in feed costs, and successful expansion into new categories like butter. In the likely case, fundamentals grow by ~1.6x to ~1.7x over three years (~18% per year), but a 2.0x return would require an additional 20-30% boost from multiple expansion (the market paying more for the same earnings). Net: fundamentals imply a ~1.5x to ~1.7x multiplier; 2.0x requires a combination of perfect operational execution and a significant re-rating by the market that exceeds current historical averages.

## E) Business Reality Check

Operationally, Vital Farms wins by expanding its retail footprint and increasing "velocity" (the number of cartons sold per store per week). To hit the base-case growth, they must successfully move from "premium/natural" shelves into the "everyday" dairy cases of massive retailers like Walmart and Kroger. This requires not just salesmanship, but a logistical mastery of their 300+ farm network to ensure that supply perfectly meets this national demand. They also must diversify their revenue mix, growing the butter and dairy segment from 4% toward 10% of revenue to reduce their reliance on the volatile shell egg market.

The key constraint is the inherent fragility of an egg supply chain. An outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) could decimate their partner farms, forcing them to source eggs from the open market at high costs, which would break the gross margin driver. Additionally, a prolonged economic downturn could trigger a "trade-down" effect where even loyal customers switch from $8 pasture-raised eggs to $4 organic or $2 conventional eggs. This consumer sensitivity would directly impact the revenue growth and P/E anchors, as the market would quickly de-rate the stock if growth slows to single digits.

The financial path to a 1.5x return is highly plausible because it only requires incremental improvements in current trends. However, the path to a 2.0x return requires a "step-change" in either the company's valuation or its product reach. For a food company to sustain a 2.0x multiplier, it usually needs to prove it is a "platform" company (like a Monster Beverage) rather than just a high-end niche producer. While Vital Farms is the leader in its niche, it has not yet proven it can dominate multiple grocery categories with the same efficiency it has shown in eggs.

## F) Multi-anchor Triangulation

### 1. Primary Anchor: EV/EBITDA

The baseline reference is an LTM EBITDA of approximately $85 million and a current Enterprise Value of $1.16 billion, representing an EV/EBITDA multiple of ~13.6x. This multiple is relatively modest for a company growing at 20%+, reflecting the market's caution regarding agricultural commodity risks.

For the 3-year outlook, we assume a revenue CAGR of 20% (reaching ~

{/\*

> > > > > gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it.
> > > > > \*/}

172 million. This is reasonable because the company has already proven it can hit 12-13% margins at a smaller scale, and the "Egg Central Station" expansion provides a clear path to lower unit costs.

Using these inputs, an EBITDA of

{/\*

> > > > > gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it.
> > > > > \*/}

2.24 billion. Adding back the estimated future cash (assuming some is spent on capex), we reach a fundamental multiplier of ~1.7x. The low end (~1.4x) would be caused by margin compression back to 11%, while the high end (~1.9x) would require the margin to hit 16% on higher volume.

### 2. Cross-check Anchor #1: Forward P/E

The baseline is a current forward P/E of ~17x based on $1.25 in EPS. For a high-growth CPG company, a 17x multiple is on the lower end of the historical range, likely because of the perceived "commodity" nature of eggs.

Over 3 years, if net income grows at a 22% CAGR (slightly faster than revenue due to operating leverage), EPS would reach approximately $2.27. This assumes that the company maintains its effective tax rate and that interest income from its cash pile remains a minor but positive contributor. This growth is plausible given the company’s recent 100% year-over-year EPS growth, though that rate will naturally decelerate.

A

{/\*

> > > > > gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it.
> > > > > \*/}

38.60, representing a ~1.40x multiplier. If the market "re-rates" the stock to a 22x multiple (consistent with high-end CPG brands like McCormick), the price would hit ~$50.00, or a ~1.82x multiplier. Landing at the low end (~1.3x) would occur if dilution from stock-based compensation is higher than expected.

### 3. Cross-check Anchor #2: FCF Yield

The baseline FCF is currently volatile due to the multi-million dollar expansion of Egg Central Station, but the company generated ~$36 million in FY2024. This represents a roughly 3% FCF yield on the current market cap.

In 3 years, as major capex projects stabilize, we expect Vital Farms to reach a "normalized" FCF margin of 6% on

{/\*

> > > > > gd2md-html alert: equation: use MathJax/LaTeX if your publishing platform supports it.
> > > > > \*/}

74 million in annual FCF. This assumption is grounded in the company's asset-light farm network, which shifts the heaviest capital burdens (land and barns) to independent farmers.

An FCF of $74 million capitalized at a 4% FCF yield (a typical "fair value" for a steady-growth food company) suggests a market cap of $1.85 billion, or a ~1.5x multiplier. The estimate lands at the low end (~1.2x) if working capital (inventory/receivables) continues to drag on cash as the company scales. The high end (~1.7x) would be achieved if the company achieves a 7%+ FCF margin through superior inventory management.

## G) Valuation Sanity Check

The current valuation is likely a neutral to slight tailwind. A forward P/E of ~17x is below the 5-year average for the stock and is low compared to the broader "Health and Wellness" CPG sector, which often trades at 20-25x. The current multiple suggests the market is pricing Vital Farms as a commodity egg producer rather than a premium brand. As the company continues to diversify and prove the durability of its margins, there is a realistic possibility of a "multiple re-rating" from 17x toward 20x.

However, in a "similar regime" environment, we must remain conservative. A reasonable 3-year valuation multiplier range is 0.95x to 1.15x. This means the multiple is more likely to stay flat or expand slightly than it is to double. CPG companies rarely see massive multiple expansion once they pass the initial "hype" phase of their IPO. Therefore, the bulk of the stock price appreciation must come from fundamental growth in EBITDA and EPS rather than the market deciding to pay twice as much for the same earnings.

## H) Final Answer

The most likely 3-year price multiplier range for Vital Farms is **1.45x to 1.65x**. This range is grounded in a realistic 18–22% revenue CAGR and moderate margin expansion, which is consistent with the company’s transition from a high-growth niche player to a national premium brand.

The bull-case multiplier range is **1.85x to 2.10x**. To achieve this, the company must successfully launch a significant new product category (such as a major expansion into milk or yogurt) that maintains the 35%+ gross margin profile, while simultaneously avoiding any avian flu disruptions and benefiting from a market re-rating to a ~22x forward P/E.

Verdict: **Borderline**. Reaching 2.0x is technically possible but requires nearly flawless execution and a favorable shift in how the market perceives the stock's risk profile.

**Quarterly monitoring metrics:** Revenue growth vs. prior year (target >20%); Gross margin percentage (target >35%); SG&A as a percentage of revenue (target decreasing); Net income per share (target >20% growth); Household penetration rate (target >6%); New retail door count; Total cartons sold (velocity); Feed cost index (corn/soy trends); Diluted share count change (target &lt;1.5% per year).
