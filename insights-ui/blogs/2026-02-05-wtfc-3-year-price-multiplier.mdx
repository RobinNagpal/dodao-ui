## **A) Anchor selection**

For a bank like WTFC, my **PRIMARY anchor is price-to-tangible book value (P/TBV)**, because tangible book value is the “equity base” that supports the loan book and absorbs credit losses, and bank investors typically pay a multiple of that equity base based on how consistently the bank can earn an attractive return on it. This fits WTFC’s economics because its long-run value creation is mostly “earn a spread, manage credit, and compound capital,” and those show up cleanly through **tangible book value per share (TBVPS)** growth plus a sustainable **return on equity (ROE)**. In contrast, EV/EBITDA and EV/Revenue are not how banks are priced (their “revenue” is interest spread–driven and balance-sheet-sized), and “free cash flow” is not a stable concept for banks because loan and deposit flows dominate cash movements and can make FCF look artificially high or low without changing underlying profitability.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #1 is P/E (preferably forward P/E when available)**, because the stock ultimately trades on “earnings power” and EPS is the most direct per-share outcome portfolio managers care about. P/E becomes especially informative when credit costs are normal (not unusually low from reserve releases and not unusually high from a credit shock), because then EPS is a cleaner proxy for sustainable profitability. This anchor also catches situations where book value looks fine but earnings are being held back by funding costs, weak fee income, or expense pressure—issues that can matter a lot for near- to mid-term stock performance even if TBVPS keeps compounding.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #2 is dividend yield plus dividend growth (and the implied payout/retention logic)**, because it is the practical “shareholder return reality check” for a bank and it catches a key blind spot: **capital structure and dilution**. If a bank is truly compounding per-share value, it can usually grow the dividend per share steadily while keeping capital ratios healthy; if instead growth is being funded by issuing shares (or if earnings are volatile), dividend growth often lags and the yield can move in ways that flag risk. This second check is necessary for WTFC because its share count has risen over time, so per-share outcomes can diverge from headline net-income growth, and dividend policy is one of the clearest, most observable signals of how much of earnings power is “real and distributable” versus “needed to support balance-sheet growth.”

## **B) The 3–4 driver framework**

**Driver 1: Pre-provision earnings power per share (what the bank earns before credit losses), led by net interest income and supported by fee income.** In FY2025 WTFC generated about **$2.224B of net interest income** on about **$2.628B of revenue**, meaning the core spread business dominates the model and small changes in balance-sheet growth or funding costs matter a lot. This driver ties to P/E because EPS is essentially “pre-provision profit minus credit losses and taxes,” and it ties to P/TBV because stronger, more stable earnings power supports a higher and more durable multiple of tangible equity. It is reasonable to focus here because WTFC’s recent revenue growth (about **+11.9% TTM** and **+11.9% FY2025**) shows meaningful momentum, but a conservative view must also recognize that bank revenue can be rate-cycle sensitive and not all of that growth repeats automatically.

**Driver 2: Credit costs (provision for loan losses) relative to the loan book, which determines how much of pre-provision profit actually turns into net income.** In FY2025 the provision was about **$95.6M** against **~$53.5B of gross loans**, which is roughly **0.18% of loans**—a “normal-ish” level for a well-run regional bank in a non-recession environment. This driver matters because a bank can look cheap on P/TBV or P/E if the market expects credit costs to rise; conversely, benign credit can support both higher EPS and a better valuation multiple because investors gain confidence that ROE is sustainable. The reason this driver is central is business-context: WTFC’s specialty finance and relationship lending can be resilient, but credit is the one variable that can change quickly and overwhelm modest improvements in margin or fee growth.

**Driver 3: Expense growth versus revenue growth (operating leverage / efficiency), which determines whether revenue momentum translates into higher EPS and higher ROE.** In FY2025 total noninterest expense was about **$1.512B** while revenue before loan losses was about **$2.724B**, so the bank has meaningful fixed-cost absorption: if revenues grow mid-single digits and expenses grow a bit slower, EPS can grow faster than revenue; if expenses run ahead, EPS growth stalls even if the balance sheet grows. This driver ties to P/E because it affects the EPS growth rate the market is willing to pay for, and it ties to P/TBV because sustained cost discipline supports a higher ROE on the tangible equity base. It is reasonable to include because WTFC has a diversified model (community banking plus specialty businesses), which can create both opportunities for scale benefits and risks of complexity-driven cost creep.

**Driver 4: Per-share capital outcomes (share count change, dividend policy, and tangible book value per share growth), which convert “bank-level” performance into shareholder-level compounding.** WTFC’s shares outstanding are about **66.97M** now versus roughly **57M** in FY2021, so dilution has been a real headwind that can offset part of net-income growth; that makes per-share analysis mandatory. This driver ties most directly to the P/TBV anchor because TBVPS compounding is the “engine” behind that valuation method, and it ties to the dividend anchor because dividend per share growth is the most visible proof that earnings are turning into shareholder returns rather than being consumed by balance-sheet support. It is reasonable to focus on because banks are regulated capital businesses: even if earnings are strong, the path to higher stock prices depends on how efficiently those earnings compound into TBVPS and how much is returned to shareholders per share.

## **C) Baseline snapshot**

Today’s setup is roughly: the stock is around **$148** (recent close ~**$147.9**), market cap about **$9.9B**, shares about **66.97M**, and the market is valuing WTFC at about **~13× trailing P/E** and **~12× forward P/E** based on your snapshot. On FY2025 numbers, EPS was **$11.57**, net income about **$824M**, ROE about **~12%**, and the dividend yield is about **~1.5%** with an annual dividend around **$2.2** and a low payout ratio (about **~18%**), implying most earnings are retained to compound capital. From the balance sheet, **TBVPS is ~88.66** and book value per share is **~102.03**, so at ~$148 the stock is about **~1.45× book** and roughly **~1.67× tangible book**, which matters because banks rarely sustain very high multiples of tangible book unless ROE is consistently strong and perceived risk is low.

Over the last 4–5 years, the direction has been solid but not “hyper-growth”: EPS rose from **$7.69 (FY2021)** to **$11.57 (FY2025)**, which is about **~10–11% per year** compounding, while TBVPS rose from **~59.64 (FY2021)** to **~88.66 (FY2025)**, also about **~10% per year**, consistent with an ~11–12% ROE and a modest payout. The complication is per-share dilution: shares increased from about **~57M** to **~67M**, so some of the bank’s balance-sheet and earnings growth did not fully accrue to each share, which is exactly why “per share” must be the lens for your 3-year multiplier. Valuation also moved around: based on year-end references in your data, P/E ranged from roughly **~9.6× to ~12.4×**, and P/TBV (using year-end prices and TBVPS) ranged roughly **~1.27× to ~1.63×**, while the current ~**1.67×** P/TBV sits at the high end of that recent band—important because it suggests the stock is not starting from a “cheap, easy rerating” setup.

## **D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”**

A **2× price in 3 years** implies roughly **~26% per year** price appreciation, because doubling over 3 years is about “grow ~1.26× each year, three times.” In a broadly similar market regime, that kind of return usually needs either very fast **per-share fundamental compounding** (for a bank, EPS and TBVPS per share) or a major **valuation rerating**, or both; if the valuation multiple stays similar, then per-share earnings power would need to rise close to **~2×** on its own, which typically means something like **~20%+ EPS growth per year** (since ~20% per year is ~1.73× over 3 years, still short of 2× without help). Because banks are capital-constrained and credit-cycle exposed, sustained ~20% EPS compounding is possible in a rebound-from-trough scenario, but it is not the default “steady-state” expectation for a well-established regional bank.

On the **P/TBV primary anchor**, doubling in 3 years would require some combination of **TBVPS growth** and a higher **P/TBV multiple**; for example, if TBVPS grows a strong but still plausible **~10% per year** (about **~1.33×** in 3 years), you would still need the P/TBV multiple to rise by about **~1.5×** (because 1.33× fundamentals times 1.5× multiple ≈ 2.0×), which would mean going from about **~1.67× P/TBV today to ~2.5×**, a level that is unusually high for a regional bank in a “similar regime.” On the **P/E cross-check**, if EPS grows **~10% per year** (again ~1.33×), you would need P/E to expand by about **~1.5×** as well (from ~13× to ~19–20×), which is also atypical for this sector absent a very special narrative or a materially lower-risk/lower-rate environment. On the **dividend yield + growth check**, a 2× price with only modest dividend growth would imply the yield compresses dramatically (because price rises faster than dividends), and that typically happens only when the market is willing to pay much more for the same stream of bank earnings—again pointing back to the need for a large rerating that is hard to assume conservatively.

Using WTFC’s own history as the anchor for “most likely,” a conservative 3-year outlook would assume **mid-single-digit to high-single-digit revenue growth** rather than repeating the recent double-digit pace, because the last few years benefited from unusually large net interest income expansion that may not continue at the same rate once deposit pricing and loan yields normalize. A reasonable base range is **~6–10% EPS growth per year** (about **~1.19× to ~1.33×** over 3 years), which aligns with the multi-year EPS compounding you already saw from FY2021 to FY2025 and does not require heroic assumptions about margin expansion. For credit, a reasonable range is provisions staying around “normal” levels similar to FY2025 (roughly **0.15%–0.30% of loans**), because nothing in the provided history suggests chronic under-reserving, but banks do face periodic credit normalization. For expenses and operating leverage, the likely path is that expenses continue rising but not faster than revenue, implying modest positive operating leverage rather than a step-change in efficiency; and for per-share outcomes, it is conservative to assume **low-to-moderate dilution** (roughly **0% to ~1.5% share count growth per year**) rather than the ~3–5% annual share growth seen in some of the past years, because repeating that much dilution would likely require another acquisition-heavy period and would usually temper per-share growth.

Industry and positioning logic mostly supports those “likely” ranges but also caps the upside in a similar regime. Regional banks compete in deposits, and deposit costs can stay sticky if customers demand market rates, which tends to limit how much net interest margin can expand without taking credit or duration risk; that makes sustained 15–20% EPS growth hard unless loan growth accelerates meaningfully and credit stays exceptionally benign. WTFC’s diversified fee streams and specialty finance niches help stabilize revenue and can support above-peer growth, but they do not eliminate the sector’s core constraints: capital requirements, credit cyclicality, and the fact that bank balance sheets are already large relative to equity, so growth must be funded carefully. Put simply, WTFC looks capable of compounding at a solid rate, but the business model is not naturally a “double in three years” engine unless you layer on unusually favorable conditions that go beyond conservative assumptions.

Comparing required versus likely, the gap is biggest on valuation. Under **P/TBV**, a likely TBVPS compounding of **~1.25× to ~1.40×** over 3 years would still leave you far short of 2× unless P/TBV expanded into a range that is well above WTFC’s recent history and above what many regional banks sustain in steady regimes. Under **P/E**, likely EPS compounding of **~1.2× to ~1.35×** similarly falls short unless P/E expands to a level that is not typical for this part of the market without a major shift in perceived risk or growth. Under the **dividend lens**, dividend growth can support a decent price path if yield stays stable, but it does not bridge the 2× gap unless the market sharply rerates the stock (yield compresses) or dividends accelerate far beyond what a conservative capital plan would imply. **Net: fundamentals imply ~1.2× to ~1.5×; 2× requires a rare mix of ~15–20% EPS/TBVPS compounding plus a large rerating to well-above-history multiples, which is above history/industry/business reality.**

## **E) Business reality check**

Operationally, the base-case path is that WTFC keeps doing what its model is built to do: grow relationship-driven loans and deposits in its footprint at a steady pace while protecting spreads through disciplined deposit pricing and loan repricing, and keep specialty finance and wealth fees growing enough to offset mortgage cyclicality. Translating that into the driver ranges means loan and deposit growth that is healthy but not aggressive, stable net interest income growth in the mid- to high-single digits rather than a repeat of unusually strong expansion, and continued cost growth that stays at or below revenue growth so incremental revenues drop into pre-provision profits. The dividend policy already signals a “retain most earnings” approach (low payout), which supports TBVPS compounding and makes the base-case per-share capital story plausible if dilution stays limited.

The most realistic constraints are the usual bank “failure modes,” and they map directly to the drivers. If deposit competition intensifies, funding costs rise faster than asset yields and net interest income growth slows, which hits Driver 1 and immediately lowers what P/E the market will pay. If the credit cycle turns and provision needs rise from ~0.2% of loans toward something closer to ~0.4–0.6% in a stressed period, that can absorb a meaningful portion of pre-provision profit and compress ROE, which pressures both P/E and P/TBV. If expenses drift higher due to wage inflation, integration costs, or complexity from diversification, operating leverage weakens and EPS growth decelerates even if revenue still grows, which again limits valuation support.

Putting business logic and numbers together, the base-case looks like **incremental execution**, not a step-change: modest balance-sheet growth, steady fee contribution, and controlled credit/expenses can plausibly produce high-single-digit EPS and TBVPS growth, which is consistent with WTFC’s recent multi-year compounding. The problem for a 2× target is not “can the business perform well,” but “can it perform so exceptionally well that per-share fundamentals nearly double and/or the market rerates the stock dramatically while the regime is broadly similar.” That would require either unusually strong loan growth without credit slippage, unusually favorable deposit dynamics, and unusually strong operating leverage all at once, plus a valuation multiple well above recent norms, which is why the 2× outcome reads as a bull-case stretch rather than a conservative base-case.

## **F) Multi-anchor triangulation**

### **Primary anchor**

On the primary P/TBV anchor, the baseline is **FY2025 TBVPS of ~88.66** and a current stock price around **$148**, implying **~1.67× P/TBV** today. Using the same year-end reference approach from your historical data, P/TBV was roughly **~1.27× (FY2023)** to **~1.63× (FY2024)**, with FY2025 around **~1.58×** at the year-end price, so today’s multiple is already at the high end of the recent range. That matters because a high starting multiple reduces the probability that valuation expansion will be a big contributor to returns in a “similar regime.”

For the next 3 years, a reasonable base set of inputs is **TBVPS growth of ~8–11% per year** and a **P/TBV multiple that is flat to modestly lower** rather than meaningfully higher. The TBVPS growth range is grounded in the last 4–5 years where TBVPS compounded around ~10% per year and ROE stayed around ~11–12% with a low payout, which mechanically supports book compounding as long as credit losses remain normal. The multiple assumption is conservative because the current P/TBV is already elevated versus recent history; in a similar regime, banks often see multiples move with perceived credit risk and rate sensitivity, and “already high-end” multiples are more likely to be a headwind or neutral than a tailwind unless ROE steps up materially.

Turning that into a 3-year multiplier: **~8–11% TBVPS growth** is about **~1.26× to ~1.37×** over 3 years, and if P/TBV is **flat to down modestly** (say a **~0.90× to ~1.00×** multiple factor from today), the price implication is roughly **~1.13× to ~1.37×**. The low end would occur if deposit competition or credit normalization pulls ROE down a bit and the market de-risks bank multiples; the high end would occur if credit stays benign, the bank sustains ~10%+ TBVPS growth, and the multiple simply stays near today’s level instead of reverting.

### **Cross-check anchor #1**

On the P/E cross-check, the baseline is **FY2025 EPS of ~11.57** and a current market multiple around **~13× trailing** (and **~12× forward** in your snapshot), which places WTFC somewhat above the ~9.5×–12.5× range seen in several of the recent year-end references you provided. This is important because it means “multiple expansion” is not an easy default contributor; the market is already pricing WTFC as a solid operator rather than a distressed or deeply discounted bank. In other words, the P/E anchor reinforces the idea that the return path must come mainly from EPS growth rather than a rerating.

For inputs, a conservative EPS growth range is **~6–10% per year** with the P/E multiple **flat to slightly down** in a similar regime. The EPS range is grounded in the company’s multi-year history: EPS rose about ~10–11% per year from FY2021 to FY2025, but that period included strong net interest income expansion, so assuming the same pace forever would be optimistic; trimming to 6–10% captures both the bank’s execution strength and the reality that spreads and credit costs can normalize. The multiple assumption is conservative because banks’ P/E often compress when uncertainty rises (even if earnings are stable), and starting from ~13× leaves more room to go down than up unless the market decides bank earnings are meaningfully lower risk than before.

Plain-English math gives: **~6–10% EPS growth** is about **~1.19× to ~1.33×** over 3 years, and a **~0.90× to ~1.05×** multiple factor yields roughly **~1.07× to ~1.40×**. You get the low end if credit costs drift up and the market takes the multiple back toward the low teens or high single digits; you get the high end if EPS compounds near the top of the range and the multiple stays around today’s level (or inches up slightly) because the market stays confident in asset quality and funding stability.

### **Cross-check anchor #2**

On the dividend yield + growth anchor, the baseline is a dividend yield around **~1.5%** with an annual dividend about **~$2.2**, and a history of dividend per share rising from about **$1.24 (FY2021)** to **$2.00 (FY2025)**, which is roughly **low-teens annual growth**. In plain terms, if the market keeps valuing the stock at roughly the same yield, then price tends to “track” the dividend: if dividend per share rises ~10%, price can rise ~10% while yield stays stable; if price rises much faster than the dividend, the yield compresses and you are relying on a rerating rather than fundamentals. This is especially useful for WTFC because it forces the question: “Is the stock price move supported by distributable per-share earnings, or just by the market paying more for the same stream?”

For the next 3 years, a reasonable input set is dividend per share growth of **~7–10% per year** with the yield staying in a similar band (roughly **~1.4%–~1.8%**) rather than compressing dramatically. The growth range is conservative relative to recent dividend growth because even though the payout ratio is low, bank management teams usually increase dividends steadily but avoid pushing payout too aggressively given regulatory capital considerations and the need to support loan growth through retained earnings. The yield-band assumption is also conservative because in a similar regime bank yields often move with risk appetite; with the stock already having rerated upward, a meaningful further yield compression would effectively be a valuation bet.

Converting to a price multiplier using plain logic: **~7–10% dividend growth** is about **~1.23× to ~1.33×** over 3 years, and if the yield is roughly stable the implied price move is broadly similar, so call it **~1.2× to ~1.35×**. The low end happens if dividend growth slows toward mid-single digits or if the market demands a higher yield (which would cap price even if dividends rise); the high end happens if the bank sustains near-10% dividend growth and the yield does not drift up, which would signal the market remains comfortable with the earnings and capital story per share.

## **G) Valuation sanity check**

Valuation looks **neutral to slight headwind** rather than a tailwind, mainly because the stock is not starting from a “cheap bank” setup on either primary metric. On your numbers, today is roughly **~13× P/E** and **~1.67× P/TBV**, while recent history shows periods closer to **~10–12× P/E** and **~1.3–1.6× P/TBV** on year-end references, which suggests the market is already giving WTFC credit for quality and growth. In a similar regime, banks can absolutely hold premium-ish valuations if ROE stays around ~12% and credit remains calm, but expanding well beyond these recent ranges is not something to assume conservatively.

A conservative 3-year valuation multiplier range is therefore something like **~0.90× to ~1.10×**. The downside part is plausible because bank multiples can compress even without a “major regime change” if credit concerns rise or funding costs stay sticky; the upside part is plausible because if the bank keeps producing steady ~12% ROE with benign credit and consistent earnings, the market can maintain (or slightly improve) its confidence. What is not conservative is assuming a large rerating (like 1.3×–1.5× multiple expansion), because that would require either a much lower-risk perception or much faster growth than the sector typically sustains in steady conditions.

## **H) Final answer**

The **most likely 3-year price multiplier** for WTFC, using all three anchors and keeping assumptions conservative, is about **~1.2× to ~1.5×**, mainly because a realistic base case is **high-single-digit per-share compounding** (EPS and TBVPS) with valuation **roughly flat to mildly mean-reverting** from already upper-range levels. This range is consistent across P/TBV, P/E, and dividend-yield logic when you assume normal credit costs and no heroic multiple expansion.

A reasonable **bull-case** is about **~1.6× to ~1.9×**, but it requires several things to go right at once: EPS and TBVPS compounding closer to **~12–15% per year** (which implies strong pre-provision profit growth, stable funding costs, and benign credit), **minimal dilution** so growth accrues per share, and a market that is willing to keep the stock at least around today’s premium-ish multiples (or modestly higher). Even in that bull case, getting to a clean 2× usually still needs either a stronger-than-conservative rerating or an unusually strong earnings compounding stretch for a bank.

**Unlikely.** Monitor these quarterly: net interest income year-over-year growth (%); total noninterest income year-over-year growth (%); provision for credit losses as a % of average loans (or annualized provision / loans); ROA (%); ROE (%); tangible book value per share (TBVPS) growth (%); diluted share count change (%); efficiency proxy (noninterest expense divided by revenue before provisions, %); total loans growth (%); total deposits growth (%) and interest expense on deposits growth (%) as a funding-cost pressure indicator.
