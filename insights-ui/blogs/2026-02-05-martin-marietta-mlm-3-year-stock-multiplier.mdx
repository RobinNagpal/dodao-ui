## A) Anchor selection

For Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), the best **PRIMARY anchor is EV/EBITDA** because this is an asset-heavy, locally advantaged “materials + logistics” business where depreciation is large and accounting earnings can swing with one-time gains, while EBITDA better reflects the recurring earning power of the quarries and downstream network. Investors typically value aggregates producers on EV/EBITDA because the business is driven by (1) local pricing power, (2) steady reinvestment in reserves and equipment, and (3) cycle-sensitive volumes, and EBITDA captures the operating engine before the noise of capital structure and non-recurring items. A pure P/E anchor is less suitable as the primary lens right now because the last few years include meaningful one-offs (FY2024 shows a very large gain on sale of assets), which can inflate net income and EPS and make “cheap vs expensive” look misleading even if the core quarry cash generation has not changed.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #1 is P/E (and forward P/E)** because portfolio managers ultimately own the equity per share, and P/E directly connects operating performance, interest burden, taxes, and share count changes into the per-share result. This anchor is more informative than EV/EBITDA when capital structure matters (MLM has meaningful net debt) and when buybacks steadily shrink shares, because a steady 1% annual share reduction can turn “company-level” profit growth into faster “per-share” earnings growth. It also captures what EV/EBITDA can miss in a leveraged, acquisition-active roll-up: if debt rises or interest expense eats into earnings, the equity outcome can lag even if EBITDA grows.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #2 is EV/FCF (or FCF yield)** because it catches the biggest blind spot in both EV/EBITDA and P/E for aggregates: the business requires ongoing capital spending, and cash generation can be pulled forward or pushed out depending on maintenance capex timing, quarry development, and working-capital swings. In a quarry business, you can “look great” on EBITDA while free cash flow disappoints if maintenance capex rises, if working capital absorbs cash in a strong volume environment, or if acquisitions consume cash (MLM’s cash flow history shows large acquisition spending in some years). EV/FCF forces the story back to what ultimately matters for compounding per-share value in a similar regime: sustainable free cash flow that can fund buybacks, dividends, and debt reduction without relying on the cycle staying perfect.

## B) The 3–4 driver framework

**Driver 1: Aggregates shipments and pricing (revenue growth quality).** MLM’s revenue is basically “tons sold times price per ton,” and because aggregates are heavy and transportation is expensive, the nearest quarry often has a structural advantage that supports pricing even when volumes soften. Historically, MLM’s revenue expanded strongly from about **$4.4B (FY2020)** to **$6.8B (FY2023)** before dipping to **$6.5B (FY2024)**, and the current snapshot shows **~$6.9B TTM** with **~18%** growth, which indicates both cyclical recovery and price/mix strength. This driver ties directly to EV/EBITDA because stable local pricing power tends to protect EBITDA in downturns, and it ties to P/E because sustained pricing plus stable volumes is what turns quarry advantages into durable per-share earnings growth.

**Driver 2: EBITDA (and EBIT) margin durability through cost inflation and mix.** In aggregates, margins are shaped by pricing discipline versus cost inflation (diesel, labor, maintenance) and by mix (downstream concrete/asphalt can swing differently than aggregates). MLM’s EBITDA margin has been structurally high—around **~30%** in multiple years (FY2024 EBITDA margin **~31%**)—and the most recent quarter you provided (Q3 2025) shows even stronger profitability with EBITDA margin around **~36%** and EBIT margin around **~28%**, which suggests strong pricing and operating leverage when demand is healthy. This driver is the key bridge between “revenue growth” and the valuation anchors: a business that can keep EBITDA margins in the low-30s through the cycle tends to earn a higher and more stable EV/EBITDA multiple, while margin slippage typically triggers multiple compression even if revenue keeps growing.

**Driver 3: Free cash flow conversion (capex intensity and working-capital drag).** Quarries are not software: they require steady reinvestment in equipment and site development, and cash flow can vary depending on capex timing and working capital as volumes rise or fall. MLM’s free cash flow has been meaningful but variable—roughly **~$690M (FY2020)**, **~$715M (FY2021)**, **~$509M (FY2022)**, **~$878M (FY2023)**, and **~$604M (FY2024)**—and even within a year the quarterly snapshot can look very strong (Q3 2025 shows **~$361M** FCF on **~$1.85B** revenue). This driver directly governs the EV/FCF cross-check and indirectly governs the equity outcome: if FCF stays healthy, MLM can retire shares and/or reduce net debt, which lifts EPS and per-share value even if EBITDA growth is only mid-single-digit.

**Driver 4: Capital allocation (acquisitions, leverage, and buybacks) that determines per-share compounding.** MLM’s industry structure rewards scale and local density, so acquisitions can create real synergy, but they can also absorb cash and raise leverage, which changes the split of value between debt and equity holders. The balance sheet shows meaningful net debt (for example, FY2024 total debt about **$6.0B** with cash about **$0.7B**, and recent quarters show cash lower), meaning that EV growth does not automatically translate one-for-one into equity value if leverage rises, while debt reduction can add incremental equity upside if EV is steady. Meanwhile, MLM has modest but consistent share shrinkage (recent shares outstanding around **~60M** versus **~62M** earlier years, and a recent quarter shows shares down about **~1.5% YoY**), which matters because even a 1% annual share reduction compounds into roughly a **~3%–4%** per-share lift over three years without requiring heroic business growth.

## C) Baseline snapshot

On the latest full-year baseline (FY2024), MLM generated about **$6.5B** of revenue and about **$2.06B** of EBITDA (an EBITDA margin around **~31%**), with EBIT around **$1.48B** and free cash flow around **$0.60B** (FCF margin around **~9%**). Shares were about **~61M** and were shrinking modestly (about **~1%**), and the dividend is small relative to price (current yield roughly **~0.5%**), which means most shareholder return must come from earnings/cash growth and valuation, not payout. On valuation today, the market is pricing MLM as a premium-quality cyclical: P/E is about **~33×** with forward P/E about **~31×**, and the current EV/EBITDA ratio is about **~19×**, all of which implies investors already expect resilient growth and durable margins rather than a mean-reverting “deep cyclical” outcome.

Over the past 3–5 years, the business has shown strong operating leverage and pricing power, but also normal cyclicality and noise from capital actions. Revenue rose from about **$4.4B (FY2020)** to **$5.4B (FY2021)** to **$6.2B (FY2022)** to **$6.8B (FY2023)**, then dipped to **$6.5B (FY2024)**, while EBITDA margin moved from about **~30% (FY2020)** down to the mid-20s (FY2022) and back to **~31%** (FY2023–FY2024), showing margins can flex but the “through-cycle” level remains high for a quarry leader. EPS grew sharply in the period, but FY2024 includes a very large asset sale gain, so the clean takeaway is not “EPS doubled,” it’s that MLM has been able to expand profits meaningfully when pricing is strong—something consistent with the business moat—yet the cycle and one-offs can distort year-to-year accounting earnings, which is exactly why EBITDA and cash flow are essential anchors for a conservative 3-year multiplier estimate.

## D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”

A **2× return in 3 years** requires roughly **~26% per year** compounded, which is a very high bar for a mature, asset-heavy materials leader in a “broadly similar” environment. In plain terms, if valuation multiples do not rise, the underlying per-share fundamentals (EBITDA per share, EPS, and FCF per share) must do almost all the work—meaning they must approach a doubling themselves. For MLM, that typically only happens if you get a combination of strong end-market demand, sustained price-per-ton gains, and unusually high operating leverage, while buybacks help by shrinking the denominator (shares) and turning “company growth” into “per-share growth.”

On **EV/EBITDA (primary)**, the hurdle is straightforward: if the EV/EBITDA multiple stays around today’s level (roughly **~19×**), then doubling the stock over three years requires EV to nearly double, which in turn implies **EBITDA must nearly double** unless leverage falls dramatically; that would mean something like ~25% EBITDA growth per year for three years, which is uncommon for a business whose revenue base is already ~$7B and whose margins are already strong. On **P/E**, the hurdle is arguably tougher because today’s P/E is already elevated (about **~33×**); if the multiple merely stays flat, EPS would need to roughly double, and if the multiple compresses toward a more typical mid-cycle band (for example, drifting from ~33× toward the mid-20s), EPS would need to rise **well more than 2×** to still deliver a 2× stock outcome. On **EV/FCF**, the hurdle is similarly demanding because cash-flow multiples for cyclicals often compress as growth normalizes; if EV/FCF moves from the high-30s area toward something lower as the cycle matures, FCF per share would need to grow at a very high rate to offset that compression and still reach 2×.

Based on MLM’s own history, a conservative “most likely” next-3-years set of outcomes is solid but not typically “double in three years” level. Revenue growth that averages **~6% to ~10% per year** is reasonable because aggregates volumes are usually low single digit through the cycle while pricing can be mid-single digit in strong local markets, which produces high-single-digit revenue growth without assuming a construction boom. EBITDA margin is already around the low-30s in good periods, so a conservative assumption is margins stay roughly **~30% to ~33%** rather than expanding dramatically, which implies EBITDA grows broadly in line with revenue plus small operating leverage, say **~7% to ~12% per year** (about **~1.23× to ~1.40×** over three years). Shares have been slowly shrinking, so assuming **~0% to ~1% per year** net share reduction is reasonable (roughly **~1.00× to ~1.03×** per-share tailwind over three years), and FCF conversion likely stays in a “healthy but variable” band (roughly **~9% to ~13%** of revenue through the cycle) rather than locking in the very strong single-quarter snapshot as a permanent run-rate.

Industry and business-position logic supports those ranges and also explains why they are hard to push into “2×” territory without a favorable cycle or major M&A. Aggregates is a local-moat business with real pricing power, so mid-single-digit price increases are plausible when demand is steady and permitting barriers prevent new supply, but volumes depend on construction activity and public infrastructure cadence, which typically do not compound at 20%+ rates for years. MLM’s footprint in high-growth states and its infrastructure exposure can smooth the cycle, yet it does not eliminate it; residential construction can weaken, private non-res can pause, and public projects can be lumpy even in a stable regime. The company can accelerate growth via acquisitions, but that typically comes with higher debt and integration execution risk, which can dilute near-term per-share upside unless synergies and pricing are strong enough to outgrow the added capital cost.

When you compare required versus likely outcomes, the gap is visible across all three anchors. On EV/EBITDA, a 2× stock outcome usually needs something close to **~2× EBITDA per share** or a material multiple expansion; the likely range looks closer to **~1.25× to ~1.50×** EBITDA per share, which would require an unusually large multiple lift to reach 2×—a tough ask when the starting multiple is already ~19×. On P/E, starting near ~33× makes 2× depend on exceptional EPS growth, and a more realistic path is that EPS grows steadily but the multiple trends down toward a more normal band, which mathematically caps the multiplier. On EV/FCF, steady but variable cash conversion supports compounding, yet not typically at the rate required to overcome likely multiple normalization. **Net: fundamentals imply ~1.3× to ~1.7×; 2× requires sustained double-digit volume-plus-price growth and/or a higher exit multiple despite already-rich starting valuations—conditions that are above history/industry/business reality.**

## E) Business reality check

Operationally, MLM hits the base-case ranges by doing what its moat is built for: maintaining disciplined local pricing (price per ton increases that at least offset diesel and labor inflation), keeping plants and quarries running at high utilization so fixed costs spread over more tons, and leaning into high-growth metro areas and infrastructure corridors where demand is durable. In practice, that means modest volume growth (low single digits), consistent mid-single-digit pricing, and tight cost control so EBITDA margins remain around the low-30s rather than drifting down when costs rise. If those conditions hold, free cash flow remains strong enough to keep buying back shares modestly and to prevent leverage from creeping higher, which is crucial for translating operating success into per-share compounding.

The realistic failure modes are also straightforward and map directly to the drivers and anchors. If construction demand weakens materially (especially residential and non-res), volumes fall and operating leverage works in reverse, compressing EBITDA and potentially de-rating EV/EBITDA because investors start pricing a down-cycle. If cost inflation outpaces pricing—diesel spikes, labor tightens, maintenance costs rise—margins can compress even with stable revenue, which hits both EV/EBITDA and P/E. If MLM leans heavily on acquisitions to maintain growth, cash flow can be absorbed and leverage can rise, which can limit per-share upside even if EBITDA grows, and it can worsen EV/FCF optics if free cash flow is pressured by integration costs and higher capex.

Reconciling the business logic with the numbers, the conservative path to a strong (but not necessarily 2×) outcome is plausible because it requires incremental execution: steady price discipline, modest volume growth, and normal buybacks funded by real cash generation. The 2× outcome, however, usually requires a step-change—either an unusually favorable construction cycle that sustains high growth for several years, or a major, highly accretive acquisition program that lifts EBITDA per share far faster than history, all while valuation multiples remain elevated. In a “broadly similar” regime, that combination can happen, but it is not the base-rate outcome for a mature aggregates leader already priced at premium multiples.

## F) Multi-anchor triangulation

**Primary anchor**

On the **EV/EBITDA** anchor, the baseline reference point is an enterprise-value multiple around **~19× EV/EBITDA** today, with EBITDA roughly in the **~$2B+** range (FY2024 EBITDA was about **$2.06B**, and recent quarters show strong margins that suggest a somewhat higher run-rate than a simple “FY2024 only” view). This baseline matters because it represents how the market prices MLM’s moat (permitted reserves, local dominance) and cycle resilience (infrastructure exposure) in one number that is less distorted by one-time gains than EPS. Importantly for per-share outcomes, EV is shared between debt and equity holders, so the equity multiplier also depends on whether net debt shrinks, stays flat, or rises.

For the 3-year inputs, a conservative set is EBITDA growing **~7% to ~12% per year** (supported by revenue growth **~6% to ~10%** plus modest operating leverage) while the EV/EBITDA multiple drifts modestly as the cycle normalizes (roughly **~16× to ~20×** rather than assuming expansion). That EBITDA range is reasonable given history: revenue has compounded meaningfully in the last cycle, but it also dipped in FY2024, and margins are already strong, so expecting another big step-up without a cycle tailwind is aggressive. The multiple range is reasonable because the starting point is already above long-run mid-cycle levels in many industrials; MLM can justify a premium because of its moat, but sustaining further expansion in a similar regime is not the conservative assumption.

If EBITDA rises about **~1.23× to ~1.40×** over three years and the EV/EBITDA multiple is roughly flat-to-slightly-down (say **~0.9× to ~1.0×** effect), then EV rises roughly **~1.1× to ~1.4×**. Equity can do slightly better than EV if net debt declines meaningfully, but with net debt in the several-billion range, even a large absolute paydown is a modest percentage of today’s ~$39B market cap, so it is usually a “few percent” tailwind rather than a doubling driver. This anchor therefore tends to land near **~1.2× to ~1.6×** in a conservative base case, with the low end driven by volume softness and multiple compression and the high end driven by sustained pricing plus stable multiples.

**Cross-check anchor #1**

On the **P/E** anchor, the baseline is the current market multiple around **~33×** trailing earnings and roughly **~31×** forward earnings, with shares outstanding about **~60M** and modest ongoing buybacks. This anchor is useful because it directly translates operating improvement, interest costs from leverage, tax rates, and share count reduction into the per-share number a portfolio manager actually owns. It also naturally penalizes outcomes where EBITDA grows but debt and interest expense rise faster, because that would limit EPS growth and cap the stock multiple.

For 3-year inputs, a conservative EPS growth range is **~8% to ~14% per year**, supported by mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth, broadly stable margins, and small buyback tailwinds rather than dramatic share shrinkage. That range is reasonable in this business because pricing power and operating leverage can lift earnings faster than revenue in good years, but the starting margin base is already high and the cycle can soften, which makes sustained “high teens” EPS compounding less likely without unusually strong demand. On valuation, starting at ~33× suggests more downside than upside over a 3-year horizon in a stable regime; a conservative assumption is the P/E drifts toward a more normal quality-industrial band (for example, **mid-20s to low-30s**) rather than expanding further.

If EPS grows **~1.26× to ~1.48×** over three years (that is what ~8%–14% per year looks like compounded) and the P/E multiple is flat-to-down (for example **~0.75× to ~1.0×**, depending on whether it compresses toward the mid-20s or stays near 30+), then the price multiplier is roughly **~1.0× to ~1.5×** on this anchor. The low end happens if the market de-rates the stock as growth normalizes and construction sentiment cools, even if earnings grow; the high end happens if EPS growth is at the top of the range and the market is willing to keep paying a premium multiple because infrastructure-driven demand and pricing remain very strong.

**Cross-check anchor #2**

On the **EV/FCF** anchor, the baseline is a free-cash-flow yield in the low-single-digits (recent snapshot implies roughly **~2%–3%**), which corresponds to a relatively high cash-flow multiple, and historical FCF has been meaningful but variable (roughly **~$0.5B to ~$0.9B** in several of the past five years). This anchor is essential because aggregates is capital-intensive and acquisition-active; cash flow is what funds buybacks, dividends, and debt reduction, and it is what ultimately makes per-share compounding real. It also naturally adjusts for capex and working capital, which EBITDA and EPS can obscure.

For the 3-year inputs, a conservative assumption is that sustainable FCF margin sits around **~9% to ~13%** of revenue through the cycle, not permanently at the very strong single-quarter level, and that revenue grows **~6% to ~10%** per year as pricing and modest volumes compound. That is reasonable because FY2024 FCF margin was around **~9%**, FY2023 was higher (~13%), and capex requirements can rise when expansion projects and maintenance cycles overlap; assuming “always high teens” FCF margin would not be conservative in this kind of business. On valuation, a similar-regime outcome often brings some normalization in FCF yield (meaning the EV/FCF multiple drifts down), especially when the stock already trades at a premium.

If revenue grows **~1.19× to ~1.33×** over three years and FCF margin is stable-to-slightly higher within **~9%–13%**, then absolute FCF could grow roughly **~1.2× to ~1.6×** depending on where you start and end in the margin band. If the EV/FCF multiple compresses modestly (for example, yield rises from ~2%–3% toward something a bit higher), the equity outcome can land closer to **~1.1× to ~1.6×** rather than 2×. The low end comes from weaker volumes and heavier capex; the high end comes from sustained pricing, disciplined capex, and using the resulting cash to retire shares and reduce debt so that FCF per share grows faster than total FCF.

## G) Valuation sanity check

Valuation is a **mild headwind** in a conservative framework because MLM is already priced as a premium-quality materials compounder rather than a cheap cyclical. The current P/E around **~33×** is above many of MLM’s own recent-history bands (often mid-20s in the provided historical ratio set), and EV/EBITDA around **~19×** is also above several past-year reference points (mid-to-high teens in multiple years). That does not mean the stock must fall—premium moats can hold premium multiples—but it does mean a 2× outcome is less likely to be helped by valuation expansion and more likely to be constrained by valuation normalization unless fundamentals outperform.

A conservative valuation multiplier over 3 years is therefore roughly **~0.8× to ~1.0×** (meaning flat to moderate compression), rather than assuming any meaningful expansion from already-high levels. That range fits a “broadly similar regime” because it reflects two common forces: as growth normalizes from a strong construction phase, multiples tend to drift down, but a scarce-asset, hard-to-permit quarry portfolio can keep the de-rating from being severe. In short, valuation is more likely to subtract a little from returns than to add a lot, unless the business delivers unusually strong growth and margin durability that convinces investors the current premium still understates long-run compounding.

## H) Final answer

The **most likely 3-year price multiplier range is ~1.3× to ~1.7×**, because the conservative path for MLM is steady mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth, stable-to-modestly improving EBITDA margins, and modest share reduction, while valuation is more likely to be flat or slightly compressive from today’s already-premium multiples. That combination compounds well, but it usually does not reach a clean 2× in three years without an unusually favorable cycle or unusually accretive capital allocation.

The **bull-case multiplier range is ~1.7× to ~2.2×**, and it requires several things to go right at once: aggregates pricing remains strong for multiple years, volumes hold up better than a normal cycle would suggest due to infrastructure strength, EBITDA margins stay closer to the mid-30s seen in the strong recent quarter rather than reverting to low-30s, and free cash flow stays robust enough to both reduce net debt and continue buybacks so that per-share earnings and cash flow compound faster than the company-level totals. Even in this bull case, reaching 2× is much easier if valuation multiples do not compress and if the market continues to pay a premium for scarcity value and permitting barriers.

**Unlikely.** Monitor these quarterly: aggregates shipments volume growth (% YoY); average selling price change per ton (% YoY); gross margin (%) and EBITDA margin (%) with a focus on sustaining ~30%+ through the cycle; SG&A as % of revenue (%); trailing 12-month free cash flow margin (%) and capex as % of revenue (%); net debt to EBITDA (x) and interest expense run-rate ($); diluted shares outstanding change (% YoY); EBITDA per share growth (% YoY); free cash flow per share growth (% YoY); backlog/lettings proxy via revenue growth vs price/volume mix (numeric % split if disclosed).
