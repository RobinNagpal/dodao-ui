Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are companies that own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate and must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. This structure provides investors with regular dividends and exposure to real estate without the need for direct property ownership.


# <a name="equity-reits">1. Equity REITs</a>

Equity REITs acquire, develop, and manage properties—such as offices, shopping centers, apartments, and industrial facilities—and generate revenue primarily from rental income and property sales. They represent the largest segment of the REIT universe and tend to offer more stable income streams tied to underlying property cash flows ([research.ftserussell.com](https://research.ftserussell.com/Analytics/FactSheets/Home/DownloadSingleIssue?isManual=False&issueName=FNER&utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Most REITs operate as equity REITs, providing investors with the opportunity to invest in portfolios of income-producing real estate. These companies own properties in a range of real estate sectors that are leased to tenants, such as office buildings, shopping centers, apartment complexes and more. They are required to distribute a minimum of 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends.


## <a name="what-are-equity-reits">1.1 What Are Equity REITs?</a>

Equity REITs are real estate companies that own or manage income producing properties – such as office buildings, shopping centers and apartment buildings – and lease the space to tenants. After paying the expenses associated with operating their properties, equity REITs pay out annually the bulk of the income to their shareholders as dividends. Equity REITs also generate income from the sale of properties. 

Because most REITs operate as equity REITs when the market refers to REITs it is typically discussing listed equity REITs.


## <a name="todays-us-equity-reit-market">1.2 Today’s U.S. Equity REIT Market</a>

Public equity REITs constitute the majority of today’s REIT market and help power the U.S. economy. They own more than $2.5 trillion of real estate assets in the U.S. including more than 580,000 structures in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Equity REITs also comprise a majority of the headline real estate sectors under commonly used [industry classification standards](https://www.reit.com/news/reit-magazine/may-june-2016/effects-upcoming-gics-classification-reit-industry).


## <a name="housing-the-economy">1.3 Housing the Economy</a>

In drafting the original REIT legislation in 1960, Congress established a broad definition of real estate because it understood that the role and uses of real estate in a dynamic economy would change over time along with economic growth and changing technology.

Consequently, there are equity REITs today that own real estate tied to almost all sectors of the economy where we live, work and spend our leisure time. REITs own real estate in a wide range of segments, including apartments, shopping centers, warehouses, hotels, storage facilities, hospitals and clinics, senior living facilities, offices, data centers, telecommunications towers and timberlands.

REITs are an effective way to raise the capital needed to help finance projects that revitalize neighborhoods, enable the digital economy, power community essential services, and build the infrastructure of tomorrow, while creating American jobs and economic activity along the way.


## <a name="housing-the-economy">1.3 Housing the Economy</a>


### <a name="dividend-income">1.4.1 Dividend Income</a>

The high dividend payout requirement for REITs means that a larger share of REIT investment returns comes from dividends when compared with other stocks. For this reason, many financial advisors consider equity REITs to be well-suited for investors seeking income, as well as for long-term investors seeking both income plus capital appreciation.

Equity REIT dividend yields have historically been higher than the average yield of the S&P 500 Index. In fact, over the long-term, more than half of equity REIT total returns have come from dividends.


### <a name="dividend-income">1.4.1 Dividend Income</a>

Equity REITs have historically provided important diversification benefits for investors due to their relatively low correlation with other assets, including other stocks and bonds. 

Diversification aims to reduce portfolio volatility, the risk that investors will see large up-and-down cycles in the value of their portfolio holdings. Some investors may seek to reduce volatility by diversifying a portfolio, for example, between small-cap stocks and large-cap stocks.

However, this strategy only divides a portfolio between different parts of the same asset class and does not achieve the full benefit of diversification. A widely accepted approach to portfolio diversification is to also diversify among asset classes.

Equity REITs, for example, have had less of a tendency to move in tandem with other equities when stocks go up or down. Over the 20-year period from the beginning of 2000 to year-end 2019, large-cap equities as represented by the S&P 500 and large-cap equity and listed Equity REIT total returns were only 60% correlated. So, listed equity REITs are effective at achieving portfolio diversification.


### <a name="dividend-income">1.4.1 Dividend Income</a>

A key concern for many investors today is how to ensure enough income for a retirement period that could last for decades. Even in a low-inflation environment, the cumulative effects of inflation over long periods can erode the purchasing power of portfolio assets. The dilemma for retirees is that it can be tough to stay ahead of inflation with fixed income securities, while equities – the traditional inflation hedge – are usually trimmed back to reduce investment risk. 

Listed equity REITs have provided, in part, a natural hedge against inflation in ways that match up well with investors’ needs. Commercial real estate rents and values have tended to increase when prices do, which has supported equity REIT dividend growth, providing retirement investors with reliable income even during inflationary period


### <a name="total-return-performance">1.4.4 Total Return Performance</a>

REITs' track record of reliable and growing dividends, combined with long-term capital appreciation through stock price increases, has provided investors with attractive total return performance for many periods over the past 45 years compared to the broader stock market as well as bonds and other assets.

REITs are professionally managed, publicly traded companies that manage their businesses with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. That means positioning their properties to attract tenants and earn rental income, and managing their property portfolios and buying and selling of assets to build value throughout long-term real estate cycles.

This drives total return performance for REIT investors, who benefit from a strong, reliable annual dividend payout and the potential for long-term capital appreciation. For example, REIT total return performance over the past twenty years has outstripped the performance of the S&P 500 Index and other major indices – as well as the rate of inflation.


### <a name="liquidity-and-transparency">1.4.5 Liquidity and Transparency</a>

For many years, investors considered real estate an illiquid asset. However, the liquidity of REITs listed on major stock exchanges makes real estate investing as simple and straight-forward as any other stock.

REITs also provide market transparency for investors, with real-time pricing and valuations. As with other stocks, investors can get in and out of their investments to optimize their exposure to real estate. Listed REITs in the U.S. are also registered and regulated by the SEC, ensuring adherence to SEC standards of corporate governance, financial reporting and information disclosure.


## <a name="who-invests-in-equity-reits">1.5 Who Invests in Equity REITs?</a>

REITs provide any investor access to diverse portfolios of income-producing assets they would not be able to afford on their own. Listed REITs are prominent in today’s investment landscape. They are included in over 250,000 401(k) plans, and approximately 170 million Americans are invested in REITs through these and other investment plans. There are numerous mutual funds and ETFs dedicated to stock exchange-listed REITs sponsored by major investment management firms. Additionally, REITs are in nearly all target date funds, the fastest-growing retail investment default option, and most pension fund and endowment portfolios.


## <a name="risks-of-equity-reit-investing">1.6 Risks of Equity REIT Investing</a>

Like other stocks, equity REIT share prices are influenced by market conditions and may rise or fall. Additionally, while the real estate market cycle is different from the market cycles for other stocks, commercial real estate remains a cyclical business. Changes in the values of the property portfolios owned by equity REITs affect the valuations of their shares. Contact your broker or financial advisor for additional information about investing in REITs.


# <a name="mortgage-reits-mreits">2. Mortgage REITs (mREITs)</a>

Mortgage REITs invest in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), earning income from the spread between the interest on these assets and their own funding costs. Because they use leverage to finance holdings, mREITs offer higher yields but are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and credit spreads ([reit.com](https://www.reit.com/data-research/reit-market-data/reit-industry-financial-snapshot)).

Mortgage REITs (mREITs) provide financing for income-producing real estate by purchasing or originating mortgages and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and earning income from the interest on these investments.

mREITs help provide essential liquidity for the real estate market. mREITs invest in residential and commercial mortgages, as well as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). mREITs typically focus on either the residential or commercial mortgage markets, although some invest in both RMBS and CMBS.


## <a name="what-are-mortgage-reits">2.1 What Are Mortgage REITs?</a>

An individual may buy shares in a mREIT, which is listed on major stock exchanges, just like they do for any other public stock. Shares can also be purchased in a mutual fund or [exchange-traded fund (ETF)](https://www.reit.com/investing/reit-funds?field_fund_security_type_value_selective=FE&sort_by=field_morningstar_rating_value_1&view_by=grid). Investors have historically found value in mREITs primarily because of their history of relatively high dividends.


## <a name="how-to-invest-in-mreits">2.2 How to Invest in mREITs</a>

mREITs hold mortgages and MBS on their balance sheets, and fund these investments with equity and debt capital. Their general objective is to earn a profit from their net interest margin, or the spread between interest income on their mortgage assets and their funding costs. mREITs rely on a variety of funding sources, including common and preferred equity, repurchase agreements, structured financing, convertible and long-term debt and other credit facilities. mREITs raise both debt and equity in the public capital markets.

mREITs typically use less borrowing and more equity capital to finance their acquisitions of mortgages and MBS than do other large mortgage investors.


## <a name="benefits-to-homeowners-businesses-and-markets">2.3 Benefits to Homeowners, Businesses, and Markets</a>

mREITs provide funding for mortgage credit for both homeowners and businesses. By using private capital to buy residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), mREITs help provide liquidity and credit to home mortgage markets. Their financing activities have helped provide mortgage loans for 1 million homebuyers. Likewise, mREIT purchases of commercial mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) provide another source of mortgage credit for business investments in commercial real estate.


## <a name="risks-and-risk-management">2.4 Risks and Risk Management</a>

Most mREITs are registered with the SEC and are required to publish regular financial statements for review and monitoring by investors and analysts.  The business risks that mREITs face are similar to those of other financial firms. mREITs have considerable experience managing many types of risk:

mREITs play an important role in the economy by helping to facilitate the housing market by investing in mortgage-backed securities. In fact, mREITs help finance 1 million U.S. homes. On the commercial side, mREITs invest in commercial mortgages helping to finance the buying and selling of income-producing real estate.

mREITs provide a simple way to hold an equity investment in the mortgage market with the liquidity and transparency of publicly traded equities – advantages not available through direct investment in mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities.

There are other mREITs whose shares are registered with the SEC but are not listed on any stock exchange. These public non-listed REITs (PNLRs) are typically sold to investors by a broker or financial advisor. Mortgage REITs also can be privately held.


### <a name="interest-rate-risk">2.4.1 Interest Rate Risk</a>

Managing the effects of changes in short- and long-term interest rates is an essential element of mREITs’ business operations. Changes in interest rates can affect the net interest margin, which is mREITs’ fundamental source of earnings, but also may affect the value of their mortgage assets, which affects corporate net worth. 

mREITs typically manage and mitigate risk associated with their short-term borrowings through conventional, widely-used hedging strategies, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, interest rate collars, caps or floors and other financial futures contracts. mREITs also manage risk in other ways, such as adjusting the average maturities on their assets as well as their borrowings and selling assets during periods of interest rate volatility to raise cash or reduce borrowings. 


### <a name="credit-risk">2.4.2 Credit Risk</a>

The bulk of mortgage securities purchased by residential mREITs are agency securities backed by the federal government, which present limited credit risk. Commercial mREITs may be exposed to credit risk through their private-label RMBS and CMBS. The degree of credit risk for a particular security depends on the credit performance of the underlying loans, the structure of the security (that is, which classes of security are paid first, and which are paid later), and by the degree of over-collateralization (in which the face amount of the mortgage loans held as collateral exceeds the face amount of the RMBS or CMBS issued).


### <a name="prepayment-risk">2.4.3 Prepayment Risk</a>
Changes in interest rates or borrower home sales affect the probability that some borrowers will refinance or repay their mortgages. When such a refinancing or repayment occurs, the investor holding the mortgage or MBS must reinvest the proceeds into the prevailing interest rate environment, which may be lower or higher. mREITs seek to hedge prepayment risk using similar tools and techniques as those they use to hedge against interest rate risks.


### <a name="rollover-risk">2.4.4 Rollover Risk</a>

mREIT assets are mainly longer-term MBS and mortgages, while their liabilities may include a significant amount of short-term debt, especially among residential  mREITs. This term mismatch requires that they roll over their short-term debt before the maturity of their assets. Their ability to do so depends on the liquidity and smooth functioning of the short-term debt markets, including the repo market. The repo market is extremely liquid, with an estimated $2 trillion in outstandings and several hundred billion dollars in daily trading volume. Banks and dealers also use the repo market as an important source of market liquidity. In the financing markets, the liquidity of the agency MBS and TBA (To Be Announced) markets is comparable to the market for Treasuries. Commercial mREITs tend to match the duration of their assets and liabilities and face little rollover risk.


# <a name="picking-the-right-reit">3. Picking the Right REIT</a>

As with any investment, you should do your homework before deciding which REIT to purchase. There are some obvious signs you should look at before making the decision.


## <a name="management">3.1 Management</a>

It's always important when buying into a trust or managed pool of assets to understand and know the track record of the managers and their teams. Profitability and asset appreciation are closely associated with the manager's ability to pick the right investments and decide upon the best strategies.

When choosing what REIT to invest in, make sure you know the management team and their track record. Check to see how they are compensated. If it's based upon performance, chances are that they are looking out for your best interests as well.


## <a name="diversification">3.2 Diversification</a>

REITs are trusts focused on the ownership of property. As real estate markets fluctuate by location and property type, the REIT you decide to buy must be properly diversified.

If the REIT is heavily invested in [commercial real estate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialrealestate.asp) and there is a drop in [occupancy rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/occupancy-rate.asp), then you will experience major problems. Diversification also means the trust has sufficient access to capital to fund future growth initiatives and properly leverages itself for increased returns.


## <a name="earnings">3.3 Earnings</a>

The final item that you should consider before buying into a specific REIT is its funds from operations and [cash available for distribution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-available-for-distribution.asp). These numbers are important as they measure the overall performance of the REIT, which in turn translates to the money being transferred to investors.

Be careful that you don't use the regular income numbers generated by the REIT as they will include any property depreciation and thus alter the numbers.

These numbers are only useful if you have already looked carefully at the other two signs since the REIT may be experiencing anomalous returns due to real estate market conditions or management's luck in picking investments.


## <a name="performance-of-reit-types">4. Performance of REIT Types</a>

The return characteristics of REITs vary significantly by type—equity, mortgage, and hybrid—reflecting their underlying asset exposures and sensitivity to interest-rate movements. Below is a detailed breakdown of key performance metrics for 2024 and early 2025.


### <a name="annual-total-returns-in-2024">4.1 Annual Total Returns in 2024</a>



* **Equity REITs** The FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs Index delivered a **4.9 %** total return for the full year 2024, outperforming many broad U.S. equity benchmarks despite a late-year rate-driven pullback ([research.ftserussell.com](https://research.ftserussell.com/Analytics/FactSheets/Home/DownloadSingleIssue?isManual=False&issueName=FNAR&utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

* **Mortgage REITs** The FTSE Nareit Mortgage REITs Index generated a **0.4 %** total return for 2024. Within that, home-financing mREITs rose **6.7 %** while commercial-financing mREITs declined **8.2 %**, illustrating the pronounced impact of credit-spread volatility on different loan pools ([reit.com](https://www.reit.com/news/blog/market-commentary/reits-gain-49-2024-december-headwinds-trim-earlier-gains)).



### <a name="fourth-quarter-2024-drawdowns">4.2 Fourth-Quarter 2024 Drawdowns</a>



* **Equity REITs**: – 8.2 %

* **Mortgage REITs**: – 6.0 %


Both equity and mortgage REITs experienced significant drawdowns in Q4 2024 as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield surged into the high-4 % range, tightening cap-rate assumptions and pressuring asset valuations ([reit.com](https://www.reit.com/data-research/data/quarterly-reit-performance-data)).


### <a name="december-2024-monthly-moves">4.3 December 2024 Monthly Moves</a>



* **Mortgage REITs**: – 4.3 % in December 2024 (index flat for the full year) ([reit.com](https://www.reit.com/news/blog/market-commentary/reits-gain-49-2024-december-headwinds-trim-earlier-gains)). 

* **Equity REITs**: Fell in line with broader market volatility; exact December move not reported but contributed materially to Q4 decline. 



### <a name="early-2025-rebound">4.4 Early 2025 Rebound</a>

After December’s weakness, REITs staged a notable recovery in the first two months of 2025:



* **Equity REITs (FTSE All Equity REIT Index)**
    * January 2025: + 1.0 %
    * February 2025: + 4.2 %

* **Mortgage REITs**
    * January 2025: + 5.4 %
    * February 2025: + 6.1 %


This bounce reflected easing rate-hike expectations and strong dividend yields drawing yield-seeking flows back into the sector ([reit.com](https://www.reit.com/data-research/data/quarterly-reit-performance-data)).


# <a name="equity-reit-subtypes">5. Equity REIT Subtypes</a>

Equity REITs are further categorized by the type of real estate they own and manage. Below is a detailed look at each major subtype.


## <a name="diversified-reits">5.1 Diversified REITs</a>

### <a name="what-are-diversified-reits">5.1.1 What Are Diversified REITs?</a>

Diversified REITs own and manage a mix of property types—such as offices, industrial facilities, retail centers, and residential complexes—within a single portfolio. This broad exposure aims to reduce volatility by offsetting underperformance in one sector with strength in another ([reit.com](https://www.reit.com/what-reit/reit-sectors/diversified)). For example, diversified REITs might own portfolios made up of both office and industrial properties, making them ideal for investors looking to gain exposure to a variety of real estate asset types.  


### <a name="examples">5.1.2 Examples</a>

**Specialty REITs** led all property sectors in 2024 with a **35.9%** total return, outpacing both broad equity markets and other REIT subsectors ([reit.com](https://www.reit.com/news/blog/market-commentary/reits-gain-49-2024-december-headwinds-trim-earlier-gains)). Their outperformance stems from:



* **Structural Demand:** Niche assets like cell towers and data centers underpin critical digital infrastructure. 

* **Supply Constraints:** Limited new development in self-storage and timber markets amid higher interest rates. 

* **Pricing Power:** Ability to raise rents or fees in specialized markets with strong underlying demand. 


Within Specialty REITs, **Data Center REITs** and **Telecom Tower REITs** have garnered particular attention for their alignment with AI deployment, 5G expansion, and ever-increasing data needs ([reit.com](https://www.reit.com/news/articles/reit-performance-in-2024-and-the-outlook-for-2025-webinar-recap)).

A comprehensive REIT portfolio requires understanding structural differences among equity and mortgage REITs, navigating sector-specific drivers, and recognizing where returns have historically clustered. In 2024, Specialty Equity REITs stood out as the top performer, but each sector’s unique risk-return profile offers investors distinct opportunities depending on macroeconomic conditions and real-estate fundamentals.
