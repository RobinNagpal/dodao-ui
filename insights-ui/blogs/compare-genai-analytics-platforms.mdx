## Introduction

As organizations embrace AI‑powered analytics, choosing the right platform becomes critical to democratize data, accelerate insights, and drive smarter decisions. In our [first article on Generative AI Data Analytics Capabilities](https://koalagains.com/blogs/2025-07-09-generative-ai-data-analytics-capabilities), we explored what GenAI can do. In our [second blog on Tools & Services](https://koalagains.com/blogs/genai-analytics-tools-services), we dug into the offerings. Now, we **compare** five leading platforms—**AWS QuickSight**, **Google Looker**, **Microsoft Power BI**, **Qlik Sense**, and **ThoughtSpot**—across key feature areas to help you pick the best fit.
