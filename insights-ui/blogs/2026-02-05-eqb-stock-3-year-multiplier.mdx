## Overall analysis (industry + sentiment + trajectory)

EQB sits in a mature Canadian banking industry where the _total_ pie (mortgage + business credit + deposits) usually grows with population, income growth, and housing turnover—not like an “exploding TAM” tech market—so most upside comes from taking share in niches and compounding book value rather than “hype rerating.” Today’s setup looks more like “value + cyclicality” than a crowded momentum trade: the stock is roughly **$107** (recent close **$107.3**), with **~37.16M** shares and **~$4.03B** market cap, a **~2.10%** dividend yield (**$2.28** annual dividend), and a **52-week range of ~$83.93–$111.18** (so the market is not pricing a boom). The forward valuation (**~11.83×** forward P/E) implies investors expect earnings to normalize rather than explode, which is typical for lenders late in a credit cycle. Macro matters because EQB is asset-sensitive: the Bank of Canada is currently holding the overnight rate at **2.25%**, which reduces “rate shock” uncertainty but doesn’t remove housing/credit-cycle risk. EQB’s own operating momentum is real—FY25 reporting highlights **~607k EQ Bank customers (+18% y/y)** and **~$138B** total AUM+AUA (+9% y/y)—but the market will still anchor the stock to _book-value compounding and credit outcomes_ more than to growth narratives.

## Primary framework: Tangible book value per share compounding + justified P/TBV multiple (bank-first-principles valuation)

### Can EQB achieve ~2× in ~3 years under this framework?

For a bank, the cleanest intrinsic anchor is “how fast tangible equity compounds per share, and what multiple the market pays for that equity,” because equity is literally the balance-sheet fuel for growing loans. Right now the market is paying about **~1.24× P/B** (recent ratio snapshot), while tangible book is around **~$81.06 TBVPS** (Q4 FY25), and total tangible common equity is about **~$3,047M** alongside **~$3,204M** total common equity (Q4 FY25 balance sheet). That equity has historically compounded: book value per share was **$46.68 (FY20)**, **$55.24 (FY21)**, **$62.65 (FY22)**, **$70.33 (FY23)**, and **$81.35 (FY24)**, which shows a multi-year “equity compounding machine” even through a choppy rate cycle. The constraint is what it takes to _double_ the stock from a P/TBV lens: if the multiple stayed near **~1.2–1.3×**, then the only way to hit **~2×** would be to roughly _double TBV per share_—which would require something like **~26% per year** TBVPS compounding for three years (because ~26% per year ≈ ~2× over 3 years). That is far above what a Canadian lender can usually sustain without either (a) unusually benign credit, (b) unusually wide spreads, or (c) aggressive balance-sheet growth that often raises risk and capital needs. The underlying profitability is solid but not “hyper-growth”: FY24 ROE was **~13.43%**, FY24 net income was **~$400.6M** on **~$2,566M** retained earnings (Q4 FY25), and the capital return policy is not extreme (FY24 payout ratio **~19.3%**, FY24 dividend per share **$1.74**, and diluted share count around **~39M** in FY24). Put simply, the math says **2× is hard to justify purely from conservative TBVPS compounding unless the market also pays a materially higher P/TBV**, and that rerating typically requires a combination of _higher sustainable ROE_ and _lower perceived credit risk_—both tough to assume conservatively for a mortgage-heavy lender.

### Realistic valuation under this framework (conservative but fair)

A more grounded TBVPS path is to assume EQB compounds tangible book in the **high single digits to low teens** rather than at “perfect-cycle” rates, because the mortgage + commercial credit environment rarely lets underwriting stay immaculate while also growing fast. EQB reported FY25 book value per share around **~$81.31 (+5% y/y)**, which is a good “starting point” that already embeds a tougher credit/spread backdrop than the peak years. Over three years, **~10–12% per year** TBVPS growth is a reasonable _mid-cycle_ assumption for a well-run challenger bank (because ~10% per year ≈ ~1.33× in 3 years; ~12% per year ≈ ~1.40×), especially given management’s long-run framing that BVPS and EPS have historically compounded around the mid-teens over long periods, but should be haircut when housing is soft and competition for deposits is intense. On the multiple, a conservative stance is that a challenger bank tethered to real estate does **not** reliably hold “premium-bank” multiples through a full cycle, so something like **~1.3–1.5×** P/TBV is a realistic zone if credit stays contained and ROE stays healthy. Under those assumptions, you get a “fair” 3-year value that looks like “TBVPS up ~1.33–1.40×, multiple roughly stable-to-slightly better,” which supports a strong but _not_ doubling outcome in a conservative base case.

## Secondary framework: Net-interest engine durability (NII) driven by funding mix + loan scale (how much earnings power the balance sheet can realistically generate)

### Can EQB achieve ~2× in ~3 years under this framework?

EQB’s economic engine is “gather deposits digitally, lend into niches at a spread, and keep costs low,” so the key intrinsic driver is how much _net interest income_ (NII) can expand without forcing either weaker credit quality or uneconomic deposit pricing. In FY24, net interest income was about **~$1,050M** on **~$3,140M** total interest income and **~$2,089M** total interest expense, with interest income on loans of **~$2,965M** and interest paid on deposits of **~$1,490M** (plus **~$599M** interest paid on borrowings). That was earned on a large base of **~$47,314M** gross loans (FY24), funded by **~$33,093M** total deposits (FY24), and it produced **~$1,255M** revenues-before-loan-losses (FY24). Importantly, the bank also has a meaningful offset from non-interest lines: **~$204.95M** total non-interest income (FY24) against a relatively heavy **~$594.1M** total non-interest expense (FY24), which means operating leverage helps only if the revenue engine grows faster than costs. To get to ~2× stock price through this lens, you usually need something like “NII up close to ~1.7–2.0× _and_ credit costs behave,” because bank multiples seldom double just because sentiment improves. The tough part is that NII growth must come from some combination of (1) loan growth, (2) spread stability (NIM), and (3) funding cost discipline—yet in Canada, deposit competition is real and the system is mature, so it is hard to assume _both_ very high balance-sheet growth _and_ unchanged spreads without leaning optimistic.

### Realistic valuation under this framework (conservative but fair)

The best “reality check” is what EQB itself just reported about spreads and customer momentum. FY25 results flagged an **adjusted NIM of ~2.07%** (Q4 **~2.01%**) and essentially flat-ish adjusted revenue (**FY25 ~$1.26B**, Q4 **~$308.1M**), which is consistent with a world where growth exists but the pricing environment is competitive. At the same time, the franchise is still expanding: **~607,000 EQ Bank customers** grew **~4% q/q** and **~18% y/y**, and the wealth/servicing footprint (AUM+AUA) reached **~$138B** (+9% y/y). That combination typically supports a “mid-cycle” NII path where NII grows in the **mid-to-high single digits per year** if loan growth stays healthy and funding costs don’t spike—so something like **~6–9% per year** NII (≈ ~1.19–1.30× over 3 years) plus modest operating leverage can plausibly drive **meaningful EPS growth**, but it usually falls short of the “EPS must nearly double” hurdle needed for a clean 2× without a major multiple rerating. One more reality check is competitive positioning: CMHC’s 2025 review notes the Big 6 expanded share while alternative lenders were broadly stable, which implies EQB’s growth is more about disciplined niche execution than the entire market shifting toward challengers overnight.

## Third framework: Credit-cycle + capital resilience (what the downside does to earnings power and what the market will pay)

### Can EQB achieve ~2× in ~3 years under this framework?

For a mortgage- and real-estate-exposed lender, “credit outcomes” are the swing factor that determines whether the market grants a premium multiple or keeps the stock range-bound. EQB’s provisioning history shows why: FY24 provision for loan losses was **~$107.0M**, versus **~$46.6M (FY23)**, **~$37.3M (FY22)**, and even **~-$7.7M (FY21)**—a wide range that tells you earnings are very sensitive to the cycle and to management’s conservatism. In the more recent run-rate, provisions were **~$34.0M (Q3 FY25)** and **~$54.6M (Q4 FY25)**, which is not alarming by itself, but it’s also not the “perfect benign credit” picture you’d want if you’re underwriting 2×. The allowance for loan losses has also moved materially (reported as **~-$109.2M (FY24)**, **~-$170.4M (Q3 FY25)**, and **~-$206.8M (Q4 FY25)**), signaling the bank is building buffers as the environment stays uncertain. Add the fact that near-term profitability can look noisy (current-period ROA was **~-0.03%** in the latest ratio snapshot), and it becomes hard to assume the market will confidently pay a much higher multiple in the next three years unless the economy stays cooperative and housing credit remains resilient.

### Realistic valuation under this framework (conservative but fair)

A conservative valuation has to price in that credit costs can remain “normal-to-slightly-elevated,” rather than reverting to trough levels. The balance sheet is meaningfully levered as all banks are (debt-to-equity moved from **~5.01× (FY24)** to about **~4.04×** more recently), and the bank is large enough that even small credit-cost shifts matter (total assets were **~$54.6B (Q3 FY25)** and **~$53.5B (Q4 FY25)**). Capital actions also show management is balancing growth and returns: in Q4 FY25 the company repurchased about **~$69.2M** of common stock while paying **~$23.6M** of common dividends, and issuance was minimal (**~$0.33M**), which is shareholder-friendly but also means “capital flexibility” is not unlimited if credit losses jump. Meanwhile, the dividend commitment is real (recent payout ratio reported **~33.38%** and dividend yield **~2.13%**), so in a stress scenario the market typically compresses the multiple until clarity returns. On the macro side, third-party credit commentary suggests Canadian mortgage portfolios should remain _reasonably resilient_ in 2026 despite a soft housing market, which supports a base case of “contained but not zero” credit pressure rather than a crisis. That backdrop usually leads to a valuation outcome that is “good upside if nothing breaks,” but it also caps the odds of a clean 2× because the market tends to keep a real-estate-linked lender’s multiple on a shorter leash until the cycle is clearly improving.

## Final verdict (most likely 3-year multiplier and 2× feasibility)

Putting the three non-overlapping anchors together—(1) book-value compounding, (2) net-interest engine growth, and (3) credit-cycle valuation discipline—the most likely 3-year outcome looks like **~1.45×** rather than ~2.0× in a conservative base case. A 2× is _not impossible_, but it would likely require **both** (a) above-trend TBVPS/EPS compounding for three straight years **and** (b) a sustained rerating of the P/TBV multiple driven by clearly improving credit conditions and stable spreads—assumptions that are hard to call “conservative” for a mortgage-heavy challenger bank. The more realistic path is that EQB continues to compound value through niche share gains and operating efficiency, but the market keeps a cyclical discount/discipline until the housing and credit outlook is unambiguously supportive. In other words: **strong upside is plausible**, but **a clean 2× in ~3 years is a stretch unless the cycle cooperates unusually well**.
