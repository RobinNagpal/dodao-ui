## A) Anchor selection

For Lightspeed (LSPD), the cleanest **PRIMARY anchor is EV-to-gross profit (EV / gross profit)** because the company is a blended model: a high-margin software subscription layer sits on top of a lower-margin payments/transaction layer. In that kind of business, _revenue_ can be a noisy denominator (payments revenue is large but carries much lower gross margin), while _gross profit_ is closer to the economic value the platform is generating from merchants. It also fits where LSPD is today: the company is still reporting operating losses (EBIT is negative in recent quarters), so P/E is not meaningful, and even EV/EBITDA can be misleading because EBITDA is hovering around breakeven and can be swung by cost timing while amortization remains large.

**CROSS-CHECK anchor #1 is EV / revenue (EV/Sales)** because it’s still the most common “how the market quotes the stock” shorthand for software-adjacent platforms, and it’s useful for sanity-checking whether the market is already pricing LSPD like a low-growth, low-confidence asset or like a recovering growth story. EV/Sales is especially informative when you want to separate “top-line trajectory” from “profitability trajectory,” because you can ask a simple question: if revenue grows mid-teens, does the market usually keep the multiple stable, compress it, or expand it when confidence rises? That makes it a good cross-check on whether the EV/gross profit view is accidentally giving too much credit to a margin structure that may not improve quickly.

**CROSS-CHECK anchor #2 is a cash discipline anchor using FCF yield / EV-to-FCF (EV/FCF, but treated carefully as ‘normalized’)** because the single biggest risk in LSPD is not whether the product is useful—it’s whether the business can convert revenue and gross profit into _durable per-share cash generation_ without constantly giving it back through SBC, restructuring, or working-capital noise. LSPD has shown recent quarterly positive free cash flow, but its last full fiscal year still had negative FCF, so using EV/FCF forces us to confront whether the “path to 2×” requires an unrealistic jump to sustained cash margins, or whether the cash engine can plausibly fund buybacks and reduce share count (which matters directly for per-share upside).

## B) The 3–4 driver framework

The first driver is **revenue growth rate (and the quality of that growth)**, because both EV/Sales and EV/gross profit ultimately scale with the top line. The baseline is a trailing-twelve-month revenue run-rate of about **$1.61B with ~+14% growth** (per your snapshot), which is already a “maturing growth” profile rather than hypergrowth. That matters because a move from +14% to, say, +20% is not just a number—given the competitiveness of SMB commerce, it would require clear share gains and stronger payments attach, while staying at +10% would be consistent with the POS market growing roughly high-single digits and LSPD mostly tracking the category. In valuation terms, if revenue grows ~10% per year (≈ ~1.33× over 3 years), EV/Sales can support a meaningful move only if the multiple expands; if revenue grows ~15% per year (≈ ~1.52×), the business can do more of the work through fundamentals rather than relying on rerating.

The second driver is **gross margin / gross profit growth via mix and take-rate**, because EV/gross profit is our primary lens and it also tells us whether revenue growth is “high quality.” Today the consolidated gross margin is roughly **~42%** (recent quarters are ~42% and FY levels are ~42%), which is much lower than pure SaaS because payments is structurally lower margin, even if it’s strategically sticky. Historically, gross margin has drifted down from the **high-50s (FY2021)** toward the **low-40s (FY2024–FY2026 quarters)** as the business mix shifted and as the company scaled payments and integrated acquisitions. That history makes a conservative assumption here important: modest improvement (for example, ~42% to ~44–45% over a few years) is plausible if software/services mix improves or payments unit economics improve, but a jump back to ~50% would require a business mix that looks more like software-first again, which conflicts with the stated strategy of driving payments volume.

The third driver is **operating leverage (expense discipline turning gross profit into EBITDA and, eventually, operating profit)**, because this is what changes investor confidence and therefore the multiple. On your data, recent quarters show **EBIT still around -10% to -12% margin**, while **EBITDA is roughly breakeven to slightly positive** (around **~0% to ~1%**), which tells you the cost structure has improved but the business is not yet in “clean profitability.” The long-run trend does show improvement: operating losses were far worse in FY2021–FY2023, improved in FY2024, and improved again in FY2025 on an EBIT basis (despite a huge impairment that crushed net income). For valuation, this driver matters because a market that sees a credible path to sustained positive operating margins is more willing to pay a higher EV/gross profit multiple; if operating losses persist, the multiple tends to stay capped even if revenue grows.

The fourth driver is **per-share mechanics: share count change and net cash usage**, because the question is a _stock price_ multiplier, not just an enterprise value story. The share count in your snapshot is about **~136M shares outstanding**, while the fiscal-year share count history was higher (around **~150M+** in recent years), implying that buybacks have started to matter in the per-share math, even if SBC and past dilution were meaningful. LSPD also carries net cash (hundreds of millions in your balance sheet snapshots), which means equity value can be supported if cash burn stops—but it also means the equity can quietly leak value if the business keeps consuming cash to fund restructuring or losses. In practice, a world where LSPD retires even ~1–2% of shares per year adds a modest per-share tailwind (roughly ~1.03× to ~1.06× over 3 years), while a world where cash burn returns tends to remove that tailwind and can even force dilution back into the story.

## C) Baseline snapshot

As of early February 2026, the TSX listing shows a share price around **C$13.44**. With roughly **~136M shares outstanding**, that implies an equity value near **~C$2.0B**, and third-party market-cap trackers put it in the **~C$1.9–2.0B** range. The trailing-twelve-month revenue baseline you provided is **~$1.61B with ~+14% growth**, and the recent consolidated gross margin is roughly **~42%**, implying gross profit is “a bit under half of revenue” (closer to two-fifths than one-half). For valuation reference points tied to our anchors, the data you provided indicates EV/Sales is roughly **~1.0×** (around **~0.98–0.99×**) and EV is around the mid-C$1B range, consistent with market sources that estimate enterprise value near **~C$1.36B**.

Over the last five fiscal years, the top line has grown meaningfully (about **$222M in FY2021** to **$1.08B in FY2025**), but the _growth rate_ has naturally cooled as the base got larger and the company moved from acquisition-led scaling toward integration and optimization. Profitability has been the bigger story: gross margin stepped down from the **high-50s** to the **low-40s**, while operating losses improved from extremely negative levels (around **-50% EBIT margin** in FY2021–FY2022) to roughly **-10% EBIT margin** by FY2025 and recent quarters. Free cash flow was deeply negative earlier, stayed negative in FY2025 (slightly), but turned positive in the most recent quarters you shared; that is a real sign of improving cash discipline, but it’s not yet a long-enough track record to treat “positive FCF” as fully durable. Finally, the share count trend matters: earlier years saw dilution (and the company also absorbed acquisitions), while the more recent period shows buybacks reducing the share base—helpful for per-share outcomes, but only sustainable if operating losses stop consuming the cash buffer.

## D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”

A **2× move in 3 years** is not a small ask: it implies roughly **~26% per year** compounding (because ~1.26× per year compounded three times ≈ ~2.0×). In a “similar regime” environment, you typically don’t get that return from multiple expansion alone unless the starting valuation is distressed; you usually need a combination of (1) sustained fundamental growth in a per-share value driver (revenue per share, gross profit per share, or FCF per share) and (2) a credible improvement in profitability that reduces risk and allows the market to pay a higher multiple. For LSPD specifically, the “per share” framing means the path must either include meaningfully higher gross profit and cash flow _while keeping share count flat-to-down_, or it must include a large rerating that offsets only modest fundamental progress.

By anchor, the hurdle looks like this. On **EV/gross profit (primary)**, a 2× stock outcome usually needs something like “gross profit per share grows ~1.5×–1.7× and the EV/gross profit multiple expands modestly (say ~1.1×–1.3×),” because 1.5× times 1.3× already puts you near ~2×, especially if share count falls a little. On **EV/Sales (cross-check #1)**, if the multiple stays near ~1×, then revenue per share must roughly double—which would require close to ~26% annual revenue growth for three years, far above the company’s current mid-teens profile; alternatively, if revenue grows ~1.4×–1.5×, you would need the EV/Sales multiple to rise from ~1× to something like ~1.3×–1.5×, which only happens if investors become convinced that profitability is becoming durable. On **FCF yield / EV/FCF (cross-check #2)**, a 2× requires LSPD to transition from “inconsistent or recently positive FCF” to “consistently positive FCF with a clearly higher FCF per share,” because otherwise the market will be reluctant to pay up for what could be temporary cash generation.

Looking at company history, the **most likely** driver ranges over the next three years (with conservative assumptions) are closer to “steady improvement” than “step-change.” Revenue growth has already cooled from earlier years’ pace, so a reasonable baseline is **~10% to ~15% annual revenue growth** (≈ ~1.33× to ~1.52× over 3 years), because that’s consistent with a maturing SMB software category and the company’s current run-rate of ~+14%. Gross margin has been anchored in the low-40s for multiple years, so a conservative expectation is **flat to modest improvement** (for example, ~42% to ~44–45%), which would make gross profit grow a bit faster than revenue if mix and payments economics improve. Operating leverage is the swing factor: given EBITDA is hovering around breakeven, it’s plausible to improve toward “low-single-digit EBITDA margin” over a few years, but getting to clearly positive EBIT margins quickly is harder because amortization and ongoing platform investment are real; that means the market may require several quarters of consistent progress before rerating.

Industry and business-position logic supports that conservatism. The POS/commerce platform space for SMBs is structurally competitive, with Shopify, Square/Block, Toast, and others using bundling, distribution, and payments attach to defend share; that competitive reality usually caps pricing power and keeps churn pressure real, which makes sustained +20% growth difficult without clear product differentiation or a strong upmarket motion. Payments growth is helpful, but it tends to bring lower gross margin dollars per revenue dollar, so even strong payments expansion does not automatically translate into SaaS-like profitability unless operating costs are tightly controlled and take-rate economics stay stable. The “stickiness” argument is real—POS switching is painful—but it mainly supports retention and steady growth; it does not guarantee rapid re-acceleration, especially when competitors can offer aggressive pricing and integrated ecosystems.

Putting “required vs likely” together, the multi-anchor view says 2× is **not impossible**, but it is **above the base-case path**. EV/Sales would need either revenue growth closer to the high teens-to-20% range or a meaningful rerating; EV/gross profit can get closer with more modest revenue growth if gross profit expands and the multiple lifts a bit, but that still depends on profitability credibility; and the FCF anchor requires sustained cash generation, not just one or two good quarters. **Net: fundamentals imply ~1.3× to ~1.7×; 2× requires a rerating plus faster-than-history operating leverage and a durable shift to positive FCF per share.**

## E) Business reality check

Operationally, LSPD “wins” by doing three things well at the same time: it keeps adding and retaining higher-quality merchants (so revenue can keep compounding around low-teens), it increases the attach and penetration of Lightspeed Payments (so gross profit dollars grow even if reported revenue mix shifts), and it keeps product value high enough that it can avoid margin-destroying price wars. In your business description, the platform’s depth in retail and hospitality workflows is the core stickiness; the realistic path to the base-case numbers is therefore not a miracle product cycle, but continued execution on vertical functionality plus payments integration that reduces churn and increases gross profit per merchant. If that happens, “~10–15% revenue growth with modest gross margin improvement” is operationally plausible, because it mainly requires steady merchant adds and stable unit economics rather than a sudden market-share land grab.

The failure modes are also very real and map directly to the drivers. If Shopify/Square/Toast push harder with bundling and subsidies, LSPD can be forced into higher sales and marketing spend or pricing concessions, which would break the operating leverage assumption and cap the valuation multiple. If payments take rates compress (because merchants demand lower fees or routing economics worsen), gross profit growth can lag revenue growth, which directly hurts the EV/gross profit anchor. If churn rises—especially among larger, higher-value merchants—revenue growth can slip toward high-single digits, and at that point the “2× in 3 years” math becomes extremely dependent on rerating, which is unlikely without clean profitability.

Reconciling business logic with the numbers, the base-case improvement path looks **incremental and achievable**, but the **2× path looks like a step-change** because it needs both “fundamentals better than the recent trend” and “a market rerating that only happens when profitability becomes credible and repeatable.” The platform can plausibly keep improving, and buybacks can help per-share results, but the business still must prove it can turn gross profit into durable earnings and cash flow in a competitive market; without that proof, it’s hard to get the multiple expansion needed for a clean 2×.

## F) Multi-anchor triangulation

### 1. Primary anchor

On the **primary EV/gross profit anchor**, the baseline is roughly: TTM revenue around **$1.61B**, gross margin around **~42%**, and therefore gross profit that is “roughly two-fifths of revenue,” paired with an enterprise value that market sources place around **~C$1.36B**. In plain terms, that implies EV/gross profit is in the low-to-mid **~2× range** (because EV is about “a bit more than twice” the annual gross profit base), which is consistent with a business that is not yet cleanly profitable but is no longer priced like a high-growth SaaS.

For the next three years, a conservative input set is: revenue grows **~10% to ~15% per year** (≈ ~1.33× to ~1.52× over 3 years) because that matches a maturing SMB commerce category and LSPD’s current mid-teens trajectory; gross margin improves modestly from **~42% toward ~44–45%** because mix can improve and payments economics can be optimized, but the historical direction has been down, so assuming a big rebound would be unjustified; and share count declines modestly (for example **~0% to ~2% per year**) because buybacks have occurred recently, but sustaining aggressive buybacks would require sustained FCF and a stable cash buffer.

Translating that into a **fundamental multiplier**, gross profit grows roughly like “revenue growth plus a small margin lift.” If revenue becomes ~1.4× over three years and gross margin improves a little, gross profit can be closer to **~1.45× to ~1.60×**, and if shares drift down modestly, gross profit _per share_ can be another few percent higher. That yields a primary-anchor fundamental value path in the ballpark of **~1.4× to ~1.7×** before any multiple change; you land near the low end if revenue growth slips toward ~10% and margins stay flat, and you land near the high end if LSPD sustains mid-teens growth while nudging margins higher and keeping buybacks active.

### 2. Cross-check anchor #1

On the **EV/Sales cross-check**, the baseline is unusually straightforward: EV/Sales is about **~1×** today (your ratios show ~0.98–0.99×), which is a “low expectation” valuation for a software-led platform and tells you the market is still discounting execution risk. This anchor matters because if the multiple stays near ~1×, then the stock outcome will mostly track revenue per share growth, plus or minus share count changes and cash usage.

For inputs, use the same conservative revenue range (**~10–15% annually**) and a modest share-count tailwind (flat to down a little), and then ask what multiple change is realistic in a similar regime. Because the company is not yet consistently profitable, it is reasonable to assume the multiple is **more likely to be stable than to expand sharply** unless operating margins visibly improve; investors typically reserve large multiple expansion for cases where losses are clearly shrinking and the path to durable profitability is no longer speculative. In other words, EV/Sales can lift, but it usually lifts _after_ several quarters of consistent margin progress, not just because revenue is growing.

Doing the plain-English math, if revenue grows ~10% per year, that’s about **~1.33×** over three years; if revenue grows ~15% per year, that’s about **~1.52×**. If EV/Sales stays about the same, that implies a similar **~1.3× to ~1.5×** enterprise value path from this anchor, and per-share results might add a few points if buybacks reduce shares. To get to **2×** from EV/Sales, you’d need either revenue growth closer to ~20% annually (≈ ~1.73× over three years) _plus_ some buyback help, or you’d need the EV/Sales multiple to expand from ~1× to something like **~1.3×–1.5×**—which requires the market to believe LSPD is transitioning into durable profitability.

### 3. Cross-check anchor #2

On the **FCF discipline cross-check**, the baseline is mixed: the last full fiscal year in your data still shows **negative free cash flow**, while the most recent quarters show **positive FCF** and meaningful improvements in cash discipline. That combination is exactly why this anchor exists: a couple of good quarters can happen from working-capital timing or restructuring timing, but a 3-year doubling case needs FCF to be sustainably positive so that equity value is not eroded by cash burn and so that buybacks are not just a one-off event.

For inputs, a conservative approach is to assume that the business can reach and sustain a **low-single-digit FCF margin** over time (for example, “a few percent of revenue”) if it continues to tighten operating costs and if gross profit grows steadily, but not to assume an immediate jump to double-digit FCF margins. That is reasonable because payments-heavy models typically have lower consolidated gross margins than pure SaaS, and LSPD still has ongoing platform investment and competitive go-to-market needs; however, it’s also reasonable to expect improvement from the FY2021–FY2025 history where FCF margins were deeply negative and have been trending toward breakeven.

If, over three years, revenue becomes ~1.4× and the company converts “a few percent” of revenue into FCF consistently, then FCF dollars could rise meaningfully from a near-zero/negative base to a clearly positive base—yet that still may not be enough to justify a dramatic rerating unless the market trusts the durability. In multiplier terms, this anchor supports something like **~1.3× to ~1.8×** on a “normalized cash power” view (because the primary benefit is removing the cash-burn discount and enabling modest buybacks), with the low end occurring if FCF reverts back toward breakeven/negative and forces cash usage, and the high end occurring if low-single-digit FCF margins become consistent and visibly repeatable across cycles.

---

## G) Valuation sanity check

Valuation is more likely **neutral to mildly supportive** than a guaranteed tailwind, because the stock is already valued at low multiples relative to its own history, but the market will not hand out a big rerating without proof of durable profitability. The simplest evidence is the company’s own multiple compression over time: EV/Sales was extremely high in FY2021, moved down sharply through FY2022–FY2024, and now sits around **~1×** (roughly **~0.98–0.99×** in your latest ratios). That means the bar for “not getting cheaper” is not high, but the bar for “getting much more expensive” is: a move from ~1× sales to materially higher levels generally requires either a clear re-acceleration in growth or a clear transition into sustained operating profitability.

In a similar-regime environment, a conservative valuation range over three years is roughly **~0.9× to ~1.2×** as a multiplier on today’s valuation level: downside if competitive intensity rises and profitability progress stalls (multiples can compress even from low levels), and upside if LSPD strings together enough profitable quarters that investors are willing to pay somewhat more for each dollar of revenue/gross profit. That range is intentionally conservative because it assumes the market does not suddenly revert to “2021-style” optimism; it only allows a modest rerating that would be justified by measurable margin and cash-flow progress.

---

## H) Final answer

The **most likely 3-year price multiplier** for LSPD is about **~1.3× to ~1.7×**, mainly because the company’s realistic fundamental path is “mid-teens (or low-teens) compounding plus gradual margin improvement,” and today’s low EV/Sales multiple limits the need for heroic assumptions but also reflects that profitability is not yet fully trusted. This range aligns with the primary EV/gross profit view where gross profit per share can plausibly grow around the mid-40% to mid-60% zone over three years, while valuation is more likely stable than explosively higher.

A reasonable **bull-case** is **~1.8× to ~2.3×**, but it requires multiple things to go right at once: revenue growth needs to stay closer to the high end of the plausible range (closer to mid-teens rather than low-teens), gross margin needs to improve modestly despite payments mix, and—most importantly—profitability must become visibly durable so the market is willing to rerate the business from roughly ~1× sales toward something like ~1.3×–1.5× sales (or a higher EV/gross profit multiple). It also implicitly requires per-share discipline, meaning buybacks must be funded by real cash generation rather than cash drawdown, so the share count remains flat-to-down.

**Borderline.** Monitor these quarterly metrics to know whether the stock is tracking toward the base case or the 2× bull case: YoY revenue growth rate (%); gross margin (%) and gross profit growth (%); adjusted EBITDA margin (%) or EBITDA dollars; EBIT margin (%) trend; free cash flow margin (%) and absolute FCF dollars; net cash balance (cash minus debt) and its quarterly change; share count (basic shares outstanding) and quarterly % change; SBC expense as a % of revenue; payments/transaction revenue mix (%) and any disclosed take-rate or gross profit per dollar of payments volume.
