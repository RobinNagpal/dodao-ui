## A) Anchor selection

For Toronto Stock Exchange–listed SaaS names like THNC that are near break-even on earnings, the cleanest **PRIMARY anchor** is **EV/Revenue (Enterprise Value to Revenue)**. The reason is practical: revenue is the most stable “core output” of the business, while GAAP/IFRS earnings can swing around break-even because of stock-based compensation, FX, and reinvestment timing. In Thinkific’s case, the company is already showing positive Adjusted EBITDA in recent quarters, but the “earnings” line is not yet a durable signal you can confidently capitalize, so **P/E is a poor anchor right now** (it looks mathematically huge when profits are near zero). EV/Revenue also fits how public markets usually value smaller SaaS platforms when growth is moderate and margins are still being proven: investors watch revenue momentum and then decide how much “enterprise value” to pay per dollar of revenue based on retention, growth durability, and profitability path.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #1** is **EV/FCF (or EV to Free Cash Flow)** because Thinkific is already producing real cash in some periods, and cash is what ultimately funds buybacks, reinvestment, or simply reduces risk. This anchor becomes more informative than EV/Revenue when the company is transitioning from “growth-first” to “cash discipline,” because a modest-growth SaaS can still create strong shareholder value if it turns into a consistent cash generator. EV/Revenue can miss that nuance: two companies can have the same revenue and same EV/Revenue, but if one converts revenue to cash at a much higher rate, it deserves a higher valuation (or it can compound per-share value through repurchases).

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #2** is **Price-to-Book (P/B), with special attention to net cash** because Thinkific’s balance sheet and capital allocation meaningfully affect per-share outcomes. The business has carried substantial cash and has used buybacks materially in the past, and buybacks can lift **per-share** value even if the operating business grows only moderately—but they also reduce cash, so you need a balance-sheet “sanity check” so you don’t accidentally assume the cash pile is permanent. P/B is not a “perfect” SaaS valuation tool, but it is a useful backstop here: it catches the blind spot where EV-based anchors can look attractive while the company quietly consumes cash (or offsets buybacks with dilution), which can blunt the per-share result.

## B) The 3–4 driver framework

**Driver 1: Revenue growth (and mix of Subscription vs Commerce).** Thinkific’s Q3 2025 revenue grew **~8% year over year to $18.6M**, with Subscription revenue up **~5%** and Commerce revenue up **~23%**. This matters because EV/Revenue is directly tied to how much revenue the business can produce three years from now, and whether that revenue is “higher quality” (sticky subscription, rising ARPU, upmarket customers) versus more transactional. Historically, Thinkific’s annual revenue growth has decelerated from early hyper-growth to low-double digits (for example, FY2024 revenue was **$66.9M**, up **~13%**). That history makes it reasonable to be conservative: expecting a sudden, sustained re-acceleration without clear evidence is usually how you overpay in SaaS.

**Driver 2: Gross margin and revenue mix (Commerce grows faster but can dilute gross margin).** Thinkific’s gross margin was **~73% in Q3 2025**, down from **~76%** a year earlier, and management explicitly links that to a shift toward faster-growing Commerce revenue. The reason this driver matters is that EV/Revenue is not just “revenue times a number”; the “number” investors pay rises when the revenue is high-margin and durable. If Commerce scales but carries lower gross margin than subscription (typical for payments/processing economics), then the company can grow revenue while gross profit grows a bit slower, which can cap multiple expansion. So this driver is the bridge between “top-line growth” and how much valuation the market will _allow_ for that growth in a similar environment.

**Driver 3: Operating leverage (Adjusted EBITDA margin moving from ~0% to sustainably positive).** Thinkific produced **Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1M (about ~6% margin) in Q3 2025** while still growing revenue, which is a meaningful marker that the cost base can be controlled. Over the prior years, profitability was deeply negative at times (the 2021–2022 period shows very large operating losses in the provided history), and FY2024 was closer to break-even on operating income with modestly negative EBITDA (also in your provided financials). That “from very negative to slightly positive” trajectory is exactly what drives EV/Revenue re-rating in SaaS—because it converts the story from “maybe profitable someday” to “profitable is visible,” and it also drives EV/FCF as more of the revenue turns into cash.

**Driver 4: Share count change (buybacks vs stock-based compensation) and cash usage.** Per-share outcomes depend on what happens to shares outstanding and net cash, not just enterprise value. Thinkific has an active buyback posture: it renewed a Normal Course Issuer Bid allowing up to **~5%** of shares to be repurchased over the next year, and it disclosed it repurchased **~1.26M shares for ~CAD$3.2M** under the prior NCIB period at an average price around **CAD$2.45**. Buybacks can lift the **per-share** multiplier even if the business value grows more modestly, but they also consume cash; therefore, this driver directly affects the P/B (balance sheet cushion) and indirectly affects EV/Revenue and EV/FCF (because the market may reward disciplined buybacks only if cash generation is durable).

## C) Baseline snapshot

As of very recent pricing, THNC trades around **~CAD$2.0** with a market cap around **~CAD$138M**. On the same “current” baseline, Thinkific’s enterprise value is roughly **~CAD$68M** and trailing revenue is about **~CAD$100M** (note: the company reports in U.S. dollars, but market data and the quoted revenue figure here are in CAD-based market convention). Operationally, the business is running at roughly **low- to mid-70% gross margin** and has recently demonstrated **positive Adjusted EBITDA** (Q3 2025: ~6% margin) with cash and equivalents of **$51.7M (USD)** and minimal debt. This combination—low EV relative to revenue, meaningful cash, and near break-even profitability—is why the upside case exists at all, but it also means the equity value is partly “cash-backed,” so changes in cash and shares matter a lot.

Over the last 3–5 years, Thinkific’s story has shifted from “rapid scale + heavy losses” to “slower growth + cost discipline.” FY2024 revenue was **$66.9M** and grew **~13%**, and Q3 2025 revenue growth was **~8%**, which is consistent with a decelerating, competitive market rather than a re-accelerating one. At the same time, Commerce is clearly a faster-growth component (Q3 2025 Commerce revenue +23% and GPV +34%), but it is still smaller than subscription, so it helps but may not “carry” total growth alone. The margin trend is the more encouraging part: the move to positive Adjusted EBITDA suggests operating leverage is becoming real; the key question for the next three years is whether Thinkific can keep that discipline while also sustaining at least low-double-digit revenue growth (because without that combination, EV/Revenue multiples typically don’t expand dramatically).

## D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”

A **2× return in 3 years** means roughly **~26% per year** compounded (because ~26% per year for 3 years gets you close to doubling). In a “broadly similar regime,” that kind of return usually needs one of two things (or both): **per-share fundamentals** (revenue per share, cash flow per share) rising meaningfully, and/or the market deciding to pay a higher valuation multiple for each unit of fundamentals. For a small-cap SaaS already sitting at a low EV/Revenue, the “multiple” part can contribute, but the market typically demands proof—durable profitability and stable growth—before it re-rates.

By anchor, the hurdle looks like this. On **EV/Revenue**, a doubling typically requires some combination like revenue rising **~1.4× to ~1.8×** over 3 years (that is ~12% to ~22% per year) and EV/Revenue rising from roughly **~0.7× today to ~1.1×–~1.4×**, because holding the multiple flat would force revenue to do almost all the work. On **EV/FCF**, if the market eventually values Thinkific more like a “steady cash generator,” you could see EV/FCF move from a low multiple (single digits, reflecting skepticism about durability) toward something like **~12×–~15×**, but that only matters if **FCF per share** rises materially (for example, if FCF margin improves and revenue grows). On **P/B**, since book value will not compound quickly when net income is near zero, a 2× share price outcome would likely require the market to pay a meaningfully higher premium over book (i.e., confidence that the business will generate future profits well above the balance-sheet base), which tends to happen only when growth and profitability are clearly established.

Based on company history, the **most likely** 3-year ranges for the key drivers are more modest than what a clean 2× requires. Revenue growth looks most defensible in the **~8%–~12% per year** range because (a) Q3 2025 was **~8%** and FY2024 was **~13%**, showing a realistic recent band, (b) subscription ARR was up **~5%** in Q3 2025, implying the “base engine” is not accelerating fast, and (c) this market is competitive and creators face switching friction but not infinite lock-in. Adjusted EBITDA margin plausibly trends from “low single digits” toward **~5%–~10%** by year 3 because the company already posted **~6%** in Q3 2025 and has emphasized financial discipline, but sustaining that while investing for growth is harder than showing it in one quarter. Net share count reduction is likely **small but positive** (for example, **~1%–~2% per year**) because the NCIB allows up to **~5%**, but actual repurchases depend on liquidity, cash needs, and whether management chooses buybacks over product investment; past repurchases exist, but they have not been “massive every year” in the disclosed NCIB stats.

Industry logic suggests those “likely” ranges are directionally right and also clarifies what would need to change to push into a true bull case. The creator/learning-commerce space has strong long-term demand, but it is crowded (platform competition pressures pricing and customer acquisition), so sustained **15%–20%** growth usually needs either a clear upmarket win (higher ARPU, larger customers) or a step-change in distribution. Thinkific is showing some upmarket traction and better monetization (ARPU **$173** and up **~5%**, Payments penetration **~61%**, and Commerce revenue growth **~23%** in Q3 2025), which supports a plausible path to mid-teens growth if executed extremely well, but the subscription base itself growing ~5% is a constraint. On margins, SaaS has naturally low capital intensity and high gross margins, so operating leverage is plausible if spend is controlled; however, scaling Commerce can mix-shift gross margin down, so margin expansion must come from operating expense efficiency rather than gross margin improvement.

Putting “required” versus “likely” together, the gap is clearest on the primary anchor. With **EV/Revenue** as the main lens, a “likely” path of ~1.26×–~1.40× revenue growth over three years (that’s ~8%–~12% per year) plus a modest re-rating from ~0.7× to ~0.9×–~1.1× EV/Revenue gets you something like **~1.6×–~2.2× enterprise value**, but because equity value also depends on net cash and shares, the per-share result is usually closer to **~1.3×–~1.7×** unless you also get meaningful buyback-driven share reduction. On **EV/FCF**, the path to 2× is more plausible _if_ FCF becomes consistently higher and the market rewards that durability; but that still depends on proving cash generation isn’t “one-off.” On **P/B**, 2× essentially requires the market to pay a much higher premium over book, which usually needs stronger growth plus clearly sustainable profitability. **Net: fundamentals imply ~1.3× to ~1.7×; 2× requires a sustained re-acceleration in growth plus durable mid-to-high single-digit margins and a meaningful re-rating that is above recent history and normal competitive reality.**

## E) Business reality check

Operationally, the “base-case” way Thinkific wins is not mysterious: it must keep Subscription revenue stable and gradually growing while pushing more creator GMV through Thinkific Payments (higher penetration), because that lifts ARPU and adds a second growth engine without needing a marketplace model. The Q3 2025 evidence says this can work—Commerce revenue and GPV grew much faster than total revenue, and ARPU rose—so a conservative base case assumes continued, steady penetration gains and modest upmarket expansion rather than a dramatic customer-count explosion. On costs, the business must keep operating expenses growing slower than revenue (disciplined hiring, controlled sales & marketing efficiency, and product investment that is targeted), which is consistent with the recent move to positive Adjusted EBITDA.

The biggest realistic constraints are competitive pressure and “growth vs efficiency” trade-offs. If competitors like Teachable or Kajabi force discounting or higher marketing spend, revenue growth could stay stuck in high-single digits, and any attempt to accelerate could compress margins. Commerce also carries a structural constraint: while Payments adoption increases monetization, it can dilute gross margin (exactly what Q3 2025 showed when gross margin fell as Commerce mix rose), so you can’t assume “more Commerce” automatically means “much higher profitability.” Finally, capital allocation can cut both ways: buybacks help per-share math, but if they consume too much cash before FCF is durable, they can reduce flexibility and raise risk—so the balance sheet must remain healthy.

Reconciling the business logic with the numbers, the base-case path to a solid (but not 2×) outcome looks **incremental and realistic**: modest growth plus cost discipline and moderate buybacks. The path to a true 2×, however, requires at least one element of **step-change execution**: either growth re-accelerates into the mid-teens for multiple years (despite subscription ARR only growing mid-single digits recently), or profitability/cash generation becomes so obviously durable that the market meaningfully re-rates the company even without high growth. That is possible, but it is not the “default” outcome implied by the recent operating band.

## F) Multi-anchor triangulation

### 1. Primary anchor

On the primary **EV/Revenue** anchor, today’s valuation reference point is roughly **~0.7× EV/Revenue** (enterprise value around **~CAD$68M** against revenue around **~CAD$100M** on the market-data convention). This is a low multiple for a SaaS platform, which tells you the market is already pricing in skepticism about growth durability and/or long-term margins.

For the 3-year inputs, I use revenue growth of **~8%–~12% per year** and a modest multiple drift to **~0.9×–~1.1× EV/Revenue** if Thinkific sustains positive Adjusted EBITDA and keeps Commerce monetization improving. The growth range is grounded in recent reality: Q3 2025 revenue was **+8%**, FY2024 was **+13%**, and subscription ARR growth was **~5%**, which makes a jump to 20%+ hard to justify without new evidence. The multiple expansion range is conservative because, in a similar regime, small-cap SaaS re-ratings tend to be incremental unless growth clearly accelerates or profitability becomes clearly durable.

Turning those inputs into a 3-year multiplier in plain English: **~8%–~12% per year** revenue growth becomes about **~1.26×–~1.40×** revenue over 3 years, and moving EV/Revenue from ~0.7× to ~0.9×–~1.1× adds about **~1.3×–~1.6×** on the multiple component. Multiplying those gives roughly **~1.6×–~2.2×** enterprise value, but because the _share price_ depends on net cash and share count, the more realistic **per-share** result is usually lower unless buybacks meaningfully reduce shares. In a conservative base case where cash stays healthy but buybacks are moderate, that translates to roughly **~1.3×–~1.7×** share-price upside; it lands low if revenue stays near ~8% and the multiple barely moves, and it lands high if growth is closer to ~12% and the market rewards sustained profitability.

### 2. Cross-check anchor #1

On **EV/FCF**, the baseline metric is that Thinkific has demonstrated periods of positive cash generation (for example, Q3 2025 generated **$0.6M** of operating cash flow and FY2024 showed positive free cash flow in your provided statements), and the market is valuing the enterprise at a relatively modest absolute level given its cash balance. This anchor matters because if Thinkific becomes a consistent cash compounder, the equity can perform well even without a high sales multiple.

For 3-year inputs, the key is **FCF margin durability**, not just “one-year FCF.” A conservative set of assumptions is that revenue grows **~8%–~12% per year**, and FCF margin settles in a **~6%–~10%** band once profitability stabilizes (this is consistent with a SaaS model that has ~73% gross margin and is already showing positive Adjusted EBITDA, but still needs investment to compete). In parallel, share count may fall modestly if buybacks continue under the NCIB framework, but not so aggressively that cash becomes strained.

Converting to a multiplier: if revenue is ~1.26×–~1.40× higher in three years and FCF margin is ~6%–~10%, then free cash flow dollars can reasonably be **~1.3×–~2.0×** higher (the low end is “growth but modest margin,” the high end is “growth plus better operating leverage”). If the market gains confidence in that durability, it may pay a higher EV/FCF multiple than it does today for a still-proving business, which can add incremental upside; but in a conservative regime, I’d treat that as a **modest** tailwind, not a heroic one. Netting it out, EV/FCF cross-check supports a **~1.3×–~1.8×** base-case share-price outcome, with the higher end requiring that cash generation stays consistent across many quarters and supports buybacks without shrinking the balance-sheet cushion.

### 3. Cross-check anchor #2

On **Price-to-Book (P/B)**, the baseline reference is that THNC trades at a meaningful premium to book value while also holding substantial cash (cash and equivalents were **$51.7M** at Sep 30, 2025, which is large relative to the company’s ~CAD$138M market cap). This implies a big portion of the equity is “asset-backed,” and the market is paying an additional premium for the operating business.

For inputs, I assume book value per share does **not** compound quickly because net income is near break-even and buybacks can reduce equity book value even while improving per-share ownership. That is why P/B is a _risk check_: it forces you to ask whether a higher share price is justified by improved earning power rather than by simply “spending cash to shrink shares.” The NCIB indicates management will repurchase shares opportunistically, but the disclosed repurchase amounts under the prior NCIB were not so large that you can assume book value will mechanically rise; instead, the operating business must earn its way into a higher premium.

As plain-English math, if book value per share stays roughly flat (a reasonable conservative assumption when profits are small), then a 2× stock price would require roughly a 2× increase in the market’s premium over book—meaning investors must become _much_ more confident in future profitability than they are today. That can happen, but it usually requires either (a) clearly higher growth, or (b) clearly higher and durable margins, sustained over multiple quarters. Therefore, the P/B cross-check says: **don’t count on “multiple magic” alone**—a large part of any move toward 2× needs to be earned through operating results that make the cash-plus-platform worth materially more.

---

## G) Valuation sanity check

Valuation is **more likely a mild tailwind than a headwind**, because the current EV/Revenue level (~0.7×) is already low for a SaaS business with ~73% gross margin and positive Adjusted EBITDA emerging. That said, the market’s low multiple is not “free money”—it reflects real constraints: moderate growth (subscription ARR growing ~5% recently) and competitive pressure that can cap pricing power. So while a re-rating is plausible if profitability stays positive and Commerce continues to scale, expecting the multiple to jump to “high-growth SaaS” levels in a similar regime is not conservative.

Translated into a conservative valuation multiplier over 3 years, I’d frame multiple impact as roughly **~1.0× to ~1.4×**. The low end is “growth stays high-single digits and the market keeps skepticism,” and the high end is “Thinkific proves durable profitability and modestly better growth, and the market re-prices it closer to a healthier small-cap SaaS range.” This range is deliberately restrained because, in a similar environment, the market typically demands clear evidence before awarding large multiple expansion.

---

## H) Final answer

The **most likely** 3-year price multiplier for THNC is **~1.3× to ~1.7×**, mainly because a conservative read of the last few years supports modest revenue growth (high-single to low-double digits) plus gradual profitability improvement, with only moderate multiple expansion and moderate net share reduction.

A reasonable **bull-case** is **~1.7× to ~2.2×**, but getting to (and holding) ~2× requires several things to go right at once: revenue growth must re-accelerate into the mid-teens for multiple years (not just one quarter), Commerce monetization must keep lifting ARPU without compressing margins too much, Adjusted EBITDA must stay solidly positive and trend upward, and the market must respond by re-rating EV/Revenue meaningfully above today’s depressed level while buybacks reduce shares without draining the cash cushion.

**Borderline.** Monitor these each quarter: total revenue growth rate (%); subscription revenue growth rate (%); commerce revenue growth rate (%) and GPV growth rate (%); ARR level and ARR growth rate (%); ARPU ($) and its year-over-year change (%); gross margin (%) to see mix impact; adjusted EBITDA margin (%) and operating expense ratio (% of revenue); operating cash flow ($) and free cash flow margin (%); diluted shares outstanding (count) and net share change (%); cash and cash equivalents ($) and net cash per share ($).
