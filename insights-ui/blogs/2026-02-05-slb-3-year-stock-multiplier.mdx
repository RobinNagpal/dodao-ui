## **A) Anchor selection**

For SLB, my **PRIMARY anchor is EV/EBITDA**, because this is a capital-intensive, cyclical “service + equipment + project execution” business where depreciation and amortization can vary by fleet age, utilization, and acquisition history, while EBITDA better reflects the underlying earning power of the operating base. Investors also tend to value large oilfield services companies on EV/EBITDA because it naturally handles the fact that SLB uses meaningful net debt (FY2025 net cash is about **-\$8.2B**, meaning net debt is material) and because it lets us compare across cycles when reported EPS can be noisy. By contrast, **P/E alone** can mislead in this industry when margins swing or when below-the-line items (tax, restructuring, interest) move around, and **price-to-book** is less informative because book value includes large intangibles (FY2025 goodwill is about **\$16.8B**) that do not directly map to near-term earnings power.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #1 is P/FCF (or equivalently FCF yield)**, because cash generation is what ultimately funds dividends, buybacks, and debt reduction, and because oilfield services can have meaningful working-capital swings and lumpy capex needs that EBITDA does not “pay for.” In FY2025, SLB produced about **\$4.37B** of free cash flow, around a **12.2%** FCF margin, and about **\$3.04** of FCF per share, which makes a cash-based valuation check highly relevant. This anchor becomes more informative than EV/EBITDA when the market is worried about whether earnings are “real cash” (for example, if receivables build, inventory rises, or capex creeps up), because those risks show up directly in FCF per share even if EBITDA looks stable.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #2 is P/E (using forward P/E as the practical lens)**, because portfolio managers still underwrite the equity on per-share earnings power over a cycle, and P/E is the cleanest way to connect operating outcomes to **per-share** value after interest expense, taxes, and share count effects. This second check is especially important for SLB because management actively returns capital (FY2025 buybacks were about **\$2.48B** and dividends about **\$1.60B**) and because modest changes in net debt and share count can amplify or dampen equity returns even if enterprise value moves as expected. In other words, EV/EBITDA can say “the business improved,” but **P/E forces the question**: did that improvement translate into **EPS per share**, after financing costs and any dilution from stock-based comp or M&A?

---

## **B) The 3–4 driver framework**

The first driver is **revenue growth and mix**, because SLB’s top line is a direct proxy for customer activity (drilling, completions, production systems orders, and digital/integration work) and because mix can matter as much as volume in oilfield services. SLB’s FY2025 revenue was about **\$35.7B**, essentially flat year over year (about **-1.6%**), which is a useful “similar regime” baseline: it suggests we are not modeling from a depressed trough, but from a mid-cycle level after the big rebound from FY2021–FY2024. Revenue growth feeds **EV/EBITDA** through scale (more activity over largely fixed global infrastructure) and feeds **P/E** through higher operating income, while it only helps **P/FCF** if that revenue converts into cash rather than being absorbed by working capital.

The second driver is **EBITDA margin (pricing + utilization + cost control)**, because in this industry small margin moves create large profit swings: service fleets, people, and technology platforms have meaningful fixed costs, so incremental revenue often carries higher margins when utilization is good. In FY2025, SLB’s EBITDA margin was about **21.7%** (EBITDA **\$7.73B** on revenue **\$35.71B**), down modestly from FY2024’s roughly **22.8%**, which implies SLB is already operating at a healthy margin level for a large OFS leader. Margin matters most for **EV/EBITDA** because it directly changes EBITDA dollars for a given revenue base, and it matters for **P/E** because higher operating income (FY2025 EBIT margin about **15.8%**) tends to flow through to EPS unless interest, tax, or share count moves offset it.

The third driver is **FCF conversion (capex + working capital + cash taxes)**, because SLB’s equity value is heavily influenced by how much of its accounting earnings turn into distributable cash across the cycle. FY2025 operating cash flow was about **\$6.49B** and capex about **\$2.12B**, producing FCF about **\$4.37B**; that is solid conversion for this kind of business, and it aligns with the idea that SLB’s technology and international mix can sustain cash generation even when growth moderates. This driver maps most directly to **P/FCF** via FCF per share, but it also indirectly supports **P/E** (because consistent cash flow reduces financial risk and supports buybacks) and **EV/EBITDA** (because better cash conversion makes a given EBITDA stream “higher quality”).

The fourth driver is **per-share capital allocation (share count, net debt, and payout balance)**, because the same business-level improvement can produce very different stock outcomes depending on whether cash is used to retire shares, reduce net debt, or is offset by dilution. In FY2025, SLB repurchased about **\$2.48B** of stock and paid about **\$1.60B** in dividends, while net debt remained meaningful (net cash roughly **-\$8.2B**) and the annual shares change was roughly flat (about **+0.07%** in FY2025 data), implying buybacks were largely offset by issuance/other items. This driver is the bridge from enterprise-level anchors (like EV/EBITDA) to **equity per share** outcomes, because even a modest share-count reduction (say **~1% per year**) can add a few points of annual EPS and FCF-per-share growth, while net debt reduction can make equity returns slightly higher than enterprise value growth in a stable-multiple scenario.

## **C) Baseline snapshot**

Using the latest full-year baseline (FY2025), SLB produced revenue of about **\$35.7B**, EBITDA of about **\$7.73B** (EBITDA margin **~21.7%**), EBIT of about **\$5.62B** (operating margin **~15.8%**), net income of about **\$3.37B** (net margin **~9.5%**), EPS of about **\$2.37**, and free cash flow of about **\$4.37B** (FCF margin **~12.2%**, FCF per share **~\$3.04**). Capital structure is not extreme but it is relevant: total debt is about **\$12.55B**, cash about **\$3.04B**, so net debt is roughly **\$8–9B**, which means equity is not a simple “mirror” of enterprise value but is still mostly driven by the operating engine. On valuation, the FY2025 reference set shows EV/EBITDA around **~8.8x**, P/FCF around **~13x**, and P/E around **~17x** (noting the “current” snapshot in your data shows some higher multiples at different observation dates, which is normal when price moves).

Over the last 3–5 years, the direction matters more than precision: revenue rose from about **\$22.9B (FY2021)** to **\$36.3B (FY2024)**, then edged down to **\$35.7B (FY2025)**, which is consistent with a post-recovery normalization rather than a fresh acceleration phase. EBITDA climbed from about **\$4.47B (FY2021)** to **\$8.25B (FY2024)**, then softened to **\$7.73B (FY2025)**, and EPS moved from **\$1.34 (FY2021)** to **\$3.14 (FY2024)**, then down to **\$2.37 (FY2025)**, showing both the power and the cyclicality of operating leverage. Importantly, FCF has been solid but not linear: about **\$3.04B (FY2021)**, **\$1.52B (FY2022)** (a weak conversion year), then around **\$4.19B–\$4.37B (FY2023–FY2025)**, implying SLB can generate meaningful cash through a “similar regime,” but investors should not assume a smooth compounding profile the way they might for a pure software business.

---

## **D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”**

A **2× stock price in 3 years** implies roughly **~26% per year** compounded (because doubling over three years requires something like “mid-20s percent” annual gains). In a broadly similar oil-and-gas services regime, that kind of return usually cannot come from dividends alone (SLB’s dividend yield is around **~2.5%–3%**), so it has to come primarily from **per-share fundamentals** (EPS and/or FCF per share rising strongly) and/or a meaningful **valuation re-rating** (the market paying a higher multiple for the same earnings/cash stream). Because SLB is already operating at healthy margins and is not starting from a distressed valuation, a conservative framing is: to reach 2×, you typically need some combination like “~50%–100% growth in the per-share fundamental” plus at least “a modest multiple tailwind,” rather than relying on one magical lever.

By anchor, the hurdles are pretty direct in plain-English math. On **EV/EBITDA**, if the multiple stayed roughly around “high single digits to ~10x,” then to double the equity you would need something close to **a near-doubling of EBITDA** (because enterprise value would need to approach 2×), and then you would still need net debt not to rise and share count not to expand—otherwise the per-share equity result is less than the enterprise result. Alternatively, if EBITDA grew a more realistic **~25%–40%** over three years, then you would need a large multiple expansion—something like going from “~10x-ish” to “~14x-ish”—to get close to 2×, which is hard to justify in a “similar regime” unless the market suddenly believes the cycle risk has structurally fallen. On **P/FCF**, if the multiple stayed around the low-to-mid teens, then **FCF per share must roughly double** to get 2×; if FCF per share rose “only” **~30%–50%**, you’d need the market to pay a meaningfully richer cash multiple (or accept a much lower FCF yield), which again usually requires either a strong cycle upswing or a major perceived durability shift. On **P/E**, if the multiple stayed in the mid-teens, then **EPS per share must roughly double**; if EPS rose **~40%–60%**, you would need P/E to re-rate materially higher at the same time, which is not the normal pattern for a mature, cyclical industrial in a steady regime.

Looking at SLB’s own history, the most likely next-three-year path under conservative assumptions is moderate rather than explosive. Revenue is most plausibly **~2%–5% per year**, because FY2025 was already near the FY2024 peak and the last five years show that the huge growth phase was the rebound from FY2021 levels rather than an ongoing secular surge; at **~3% per year**, revenue growth is only about **~1.09×** over three years. EBITDA margin is most plausibly **roughly stable to slightly up**, say **~21%–23%**, because SLB already delivered **~21.7%** in FY2025 and **~22.8%** in FY2024; big margin expansion is difficult in oilfield services without a strong pricing cycle, but modest improvement is plausible if mix shifts toward higher-value international, offshore, and digital/integration work. FCF conversion is most plausibly “solid but not perfect,” consistent with FY2023–FY2025 FCF around **\$4.2B–\$4.4B**; that supports a reasonable expectation of **~5%–10% annual FCF-per-share growth** if revenue creeps up and buybacks modestly reduce share count, implying something like **~1.15×–1.35×** FCF per share over three years rather than 2×.

Industry logic reinforces that conservative view and helps bound it. In a “broadly similar” environment, upstream customers tend to keep capex disciplined, which supports steady service demand but often caps the kind of frenzy that produces dramatic pricing power for contractors; that makes **mid-single-digit revenue growth** more plausible than high-teens growth. SLB’s positioning—global scale, heavy international exposure, technology leadership, and a growing digital/integration footprint—does support **better stability** than smaller peers, which is why stable-to-slightly-higher margins are not a stretch; however, it does not eliminate cyclicality, and competition plus customer bargaining power limits how far margins can expand without a clear tightening of service capacity. Importantly, because SLB already runs at strong utilization and profitability (mid-teens operating margin in FY2025), the “easy” operating leverage has largely been harvested, so the next leg typically looks like incremental improvement rather than a step-change.

When you compare “required” vs “likely” through all three anchors, the gap is visible. Under **EV/EBITDA**, a realistic fundamental path might be EBITDA up **~15%–35%** (from modest revenue growth and stable/slightly better margins), which would imply something like **~1.15×–1.35×** enterprise value if the multiple is flat, and perhaps **~1.25×–1.60×** equity per share if net debt edges down and shares shrink modestly; getting to 2× would generally require **either** EBITDA up something like **~60%–100%** **or** a large multiple re-rate, both above what the recent range suggests in a steady regime. Under **P/FCF**, a likely FCF-per-share outcome of **~1.15×–1.35×** with a mostly stable cash multiple leads to a similar price range; to reach 2× you’d need **FCF per share to roughly double** or the market to accept a far lower FCF yield than has been typical for SLB in recent years. Under **P/E**, EPS would need to approach **~\$4.7** versus FY2025’s **\$2.37** to justify 2× at a similar multiple; SLB did hit **~\$3.14** in FY2024, but sustaining and expanding from there to near-\$5 without a strong upcycle is a high bar. **Net: fundamentals imply ~1.25× to ~1.60×; 2× requires a strong upcycle (higher activity + pricing) and/or a major multiple re-rate that sits above history/industry/business reality in a “similar regime.”**

## **E) Business reality check**

Operationally, the “base-case win” for SLB looks like steady international project execution plus modest mix improvement rather than a dramatic volume surge. To hit moderate revenue growth (say **~2%–5% annually**) and hold EBITDA margins around **~21%–23%**, SLB needs to keep its premium technology and integration model working: winning and delivering complex well construction and production system work, maintaining utilization in its high-value fleets, and expanding digital/integration penetration that tends to be stickier and higher-value than commoditized spot work. On the cash side, sustaining FCF near (or above) the recent **~\$4.2B–\$4.4B** level requires keeping capex disciplined (FY2025 capex was about **\$2.12B**) and avoiding major working-capital leakage, so that EBITDA turns into real cash that can support dividends and buybacks without levering up.

The most realistic constraints are the ones that typically cap cyclical industrial upside in a steady regime. If upstream spending softens or remains flat, revenue growth can stall, and in oilfield services, flat volumes often increase price competition, which can compress margins even if SLB is best-in-class; that would hit **EV/EBITDA** through lower EBITDA and hit **P/E** through lower EPS. Working capital is another failure mode: when receivables rise or inventory builds (both are meaningful line items for SLB), reported profits can look fine while cash conversion weakens, which would specifically break the **P/FCF** anchor. Finally, per-share outcomes can disappoint if buybacks are offset by stock issuance (stock comp or M&A) or if net debt rises; in that case, enterprise value might grow but equity per share grows less, which is exactly why we keep the per-share lens front and center.

Putting business logic and numbers together, the path to a “good but not euphoric” outcome looks plausible, while the path to 2× looks like it requires a step-change in cycle conditions. Incremental improvements—small revenue growth, stable margins, and steady cash conversion—fit SLB’s scale, diversification, and recent financial pattern, and they support a **~1.25×–1.60×** kind of price outcome without assuming anything heroic. But to get to **2×**, SLB likely needs either a materially stronger pricing/upstream activity environment than “broadly similar,” or a durable perception shift that makes investors pay a much higher multiple for the same cyclical cash flows; neither is impossible, but both are meaningfully above the conservative baseline.

## **F) Multi-anchor triangulation**

### **1) Primary anchor**

The EV/EBITDA baseline is anchored on FY2025 EBITDA of about **\$7.73B** and an EV/EBITDA reference around **~8.8x** in the FY2025 ratio set, with “near-current” snapshots in your data showing EV/EBITDA closer to the high single digits to around **~10x** depending on the observation date. This is a reasonable starting point because it reflects SLB after the post-2021 rebound, with EBITDA margins already around **~22%**, rather than valuing from a depressed trough where mean reversion can do most of the work.

For the next three years, a conservative input set is revenue growth **~2%–5% per year** (consistent with a mature cycle after FY2025’s flat revenue), EBITDA margin **~21%–23%** (near the FY2024–FY2025 band), and modest net leverage improvement (net debt roughly **\$8–9B** today drifting slightly down if FCF stays around **\$4B+** and some is used to repay debt). These are reasonable because SLB has already demonstrated the ability to hold mid-20s gross margin and low-20s EBITDA margin through FY2023–FY2025, but the same history also shows that EBITDA and EPS can decline when the cycle cools (FY2024 to FY2025), so we should not assume a fresh margin breakout without a clear cycle catalyst.

If revenue compounds at **~3%** annually (about **~1.09×** over three years) and EBITDA margin is roughly stable, EBITDA might rise roughly in line with revenue, say **~1.10×–1.25×** depending on whether mix and utilization improve modestly. If the EV/EBITDA multiple is flat to slightly higher in a similar regime (for example, “~0.95×–1.10×” as a valuation factor), that produces an enterprise-value change of roughly **~1.05×–1.38×**; after allowing for modest net debt reduction and modest net share reduction, the equity per-share outcome plausibly lands around **~1.20×–1.55×**. The low end corresponds to flat activity and a mild de-rating; the high end corresponds to steady activity, slightly better mix/margins, and a stable-to-slightly-firmer multiple.

### **2) Cross-check anchor #1**

The P/FCF baseline is FY2025 free cash flow of about **\$4.37B**, which was about **~12.2%** of revenue, and FCF per share of about **\$3.04**, with a P/FCF reference around **~13x** in the FY2025 ratios (again noting that “current” snapshots can be higher if price moved faster than trailing FCF). This anchor is grounded in the reality that SLB’s equity story is materially about how much cash it can generate and return, as evidenced by FY2025 dividends of about **\$1.60B** and buybacks of about **\$2.48B**.

A conservative three-year cash input set is FCF margin holding roughly in the **~10%–13%** band, capex staying in the “low single-digit billions” zone similar to FY2025’s **~\$2.1B**, and working capital being roughly neutral across the period rather than a persistent drag. This is reasonable because SLB’s FY2023–FY2025 FCF margins were consistently around **~11%–13%** (except the weaker FY2022), but it is also realistic to assume variability quarter-to-quarter because large service businesses often see timing swings in receivables and payables; that is exactly why we use a range rather than a single point estimate.

If FCF per share grows at **~5%–10% per year** (which could come from a mix of modest revenue growth, stable margins, and a small net share-count reduction), that is about **~1.16×–1.33×** over three years. If the market applies a broadly similar cash multiple (say, P/FCF roughly stable, implying a valuation factor around **~0.95×–1.10×**), then the implied price multiplier is roughly **~1.10×–1.46×** from this anchor. The low end happens if cash conversion weakens (working capital or capex creeps up) and the market demands a higher cash yield; the high end happens if SLB sustains the FY2023–FY2025 cash quality and continues meaningful buybacks without offsetting dilution.

### **3) Cross-check anchor #2**

The P/E baseline uses FY2025 EPS of about **\$2.37**, with a P/E reference around **~17x** in the FY2025 ratios and a forward P/E in the mid-teens in your market snapshot (forward P/E about **~16.5x**). This is a useful cross-check because it forces us to translate business performance into **after-interest, after-tax** earnings per share, which matters for a company with real but manageable leverage (FY2025 debt/EBITDA about **~1.36x**) and an active capital return program.

A conservative EPS input set is EPS growth driven mainly by modest operating growth rather than multiple expansion: for example, revenue up **~2%–5%** per year, operating margins roughly in the mid-teens (FY2025 operating margin **~15.8%**, FY2024 **~17.6%**), and net share count flat to slightly down over time. This is reasonable because SLB’s EPS has shown it can move from **\$1.34 (FY2021)** to **\$3.14 (FY2024)** when the cycle improves, but it also fell to **\$2.37 (FY2025)** when conditions cooled, so a “similar regime” expectation should sit between “flat” and “strong upcycle,” not at the peak-rebound pace.

If EPS grows at **~6%–12%** annually from a FY2025 base (reflecting modest activity growth plus some per-share help from buybacks), that is about **~1.19×–1.40×** over three years. If P/E stays broadly similar (valuation factor **~0.95×–1.10×**), the implied price multiplier is roughly **~1.13×–1.54×** on this anchor, which lines up with the EV/EBITDA and P/FCF pictures. The low end corresponds to weaker margins or higher costs (reducing EPS leverage), while the high end corresponds to a mild upturn and better operating leverage without assuming an aggressive re-rating.

---

## **G) Valuation sanity check**

On balance, valuation looks **neutral to slightly supportive**, not a clear tailwind, because SLB’s current multiples are not distressed but also not at euphoric peaks. In your history set, EV/EBITDA ranged from roughly **~7.7x (FY2024)** to **~14.8x (FY2022)**, with FY2025 around **~8.8x**, which suggests today is closer to the lower half of the recent cycle if the market believes earnings are durable; however, the same history shows that when cycle risk rises, multiples can compress even if the company executes well. Similarly, P/E ranged from about **~12x (FY2024)** to **~22x (FY2021–FY2022)** with FY2025 around **~17x**, implying we are not starting from a “cheap enough to double just on mean reversion” point.

In a “broadly similar regime,” a conservative valuation multiplier over three years is **~0.9×–1.2×**. The downside part of that range reflects the reality that cyclical industrial multiples can drift lower if investors worry about upstream spending, even without a major recession; the upside part reflects a reasonable scenario where SLB’s mix (international + technology + integration) earns a modest durability premium, nudging EV/EBITDA or P/E slightly higher without requiring a regime change. Crucially, this range does not assume a dramatic re-rating, because a dramatic re-rating is usually the thing that _is_ the regime change.

---

## **H) Final answer**

The **most likely 3-year stock price multiplier for SLB is ~1.25× to ~1.60×**, because a conservative “similar regime” outlook supports modest growth in revenue and cash generation, stable-to-slightly-better margins, and some per-share benefit from capital returns, but it does not naturally produce the kind of explosive per-share fundamental growth that a 2× outcome requires. All three anchors—EV/EBITDA, P/FCF, and P/E—cluster in that same neighborhood when you assume mid-single-digit fundamental progress and mostly stable valuation.

A reasonable **bull-case** is **~1.60× to ~2.10×**, but it requires a clearly better-than-baseline operating environment where SLB gets both stronger fundamentals and at least a modest multiple tailwind at the same time. In practice that means EBITDA and EPS per share must grow more like “low-teens per year” (which is roughly **~1.35×–1.45×** over three years) _and_ the market must pay a meaningfully higher multiple than today (for example, EV/EBITDA moving from ~10x-ish toward the low-teens) because investors perceive tighter service capacity, stronger pricing, or higher durability of international/offshore and digital earnings; without both pieces, you tend to land short of 2×.

**Verdict: Borderline** for reaching **2×** in 3 years under “similar regime” assumptions. Monitor quarterly revenue growth (year-over-year %); quarterly EBITDA margin (%); quarterly operating margin (%); trailing-twelve-month FCF margin (%); trailing-twelve-month FCF per share ($); capex as a % of revenue (%); net debt to EBITDA (x); diluted share count (billions); backlog/order backlog ($, where disclosed); ROIC or ROCE (%).
