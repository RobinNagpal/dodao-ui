## A) Anchor selection

### Primary Anchor: Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The Price-to-Earnings ratio is the most suitable primary valuation metric for Atmus Filtration Technologies because the company is a mature, profitable industrial spin-off with a stable capital structure. Investors in this sector typically focus on "bottom-line" compounding—specifically how well the company translates steady revenue into Earnings Per Share (EPS) through margin preservation and share buybacks. Since Atmus has a consistent tax rate and is now establishing a standalone earnings track record independent of Cummins, P/E captures the net value accretion available to equity holders better than revenue multiples, which ignore the company's distinct cost structure and profitability profile.

### Cross-Check Anchor #1: EV/EBITDA

I will use Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) as the first cross-check because it neutralizes the impact of Atmus’s post-spin-off capital structure and tax jurisdictions, allowing for a cleaner comparison against industrial peers like Donaldson or Parker-Hannifin. This metric is more informative than EPS when assessing the core operating performance of the business, as it strips out interest expense and non-cash depreciation. Given that Atmus carries approximately $618 million in total debt (as of Q3 2025), EV/EBITDA ensures we are accounting for the debt obligations that sit ahead of equity holders, preventing us from overvaluing the stock simply because of financial leverage.

### Cross-Check Anchor #2: Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield

Free Cash Flow Yield is the necessary "risk control" anchor because reported earnings can be temporarily distorted by working capital fluctuations, which have been volatile for Atmus recently (e.g., FY24 FCF dropped to $56.8M due to working capital drag, while FY23 was $143.2M). This metric is critical because dividends and share repurchases—key components of the investment thesis—are funded by actual cash, not accounting profits. If the company trades at a reasonable P/E but a meager FCF yield, it indicates "low quality" earnings or capital intensity issues that could derail the shareholder return story required to drive the stock price higher.

## B) The 3–4 driver framework

### Driver 1: Aftermarket Revenue Growth

The most critical top-line lever is the recurring revenue from the aftermarket business, which accounts for the vast majority of profits. This driver is governed by the "active truck population" (total vehicles on the road) and utilization rates (miles driven), rather than volatile new truck sales. Historically, this segment grows at GDP-plus levels, typically 2% to 4% organically. For Atmus to succeed, they must maintain pricing power to offset inflation, targeting roughly ~3% to ~5% annual revenue growth. If growth dips below 2%, fixed cost absorption fails; if it exceeds 5%, it implies successful market share capture from competitors or rapid adoption in off-highway sectors.

### Driver 2: EBITDA Margin Expansion

EBITDA margin represents the company's ability to control input costs and leverage its fixed manufacturing base. Atmus currently operates with EBITDA margins in the ~17% to ~19% range (LTM EBITDA margin ~17.1%). As a newly independent company, the bull case relies on their ability to trim "stranded costs" from the Cummins separation and optimize their own supply chain to push margins toward 20%. However, this impacts the valuation anchors significantly: a 100 basis point (1%) improvement in margin flows directly to the bottom line, acting as a multiplier on EPS and reducing the EV/EBITDA multiple.

### Driver 3: Capital Allocation (Share Count Reduction)

With a mature, low-growth business, reducing the denominator (share count) is a mathematical necessity to accelerate EPS growth above revenue growth. Atmus has already begun this, reducing shares from ~83M to ~81.5M recently. The driver here is the "buyback yield," or the percentage of market cap retired annually. Assuming they use their normalized free cash flow (approx. $150M range) primarily for buybacks after modest dividends, they could realistically reduce the share count by ~2% to ~3% per year. This directly inflates the EPS used in our Primary Anchor and supports the stock price even if the valuation multiple stays flat.

### Driver 4: Valuation Multiple Sensitivity (Re-rating Risk)

The final driver is the market's willingness to pay for these earnings, specifically the P/E multiple. Atmus currently trades at a forward P/E of ~20.5x, which is relatively rich for a combustion-engine-linked industrial. The risk here is "terminal value compression"—as the timeline for Electric Vehicles (BEV) advances, investors may lower the multiple they are willing to pay for ICE-related earnings, fearing a melting ice cube. If the multiple contracts from ~20x to ~15x (a standard industrial multiple), fundamentals must grow 33% just to keep the stock price flat. This driver impacts all anchors but is most visible in the P/E triangulation.

## C) Baseline snapshot

### Current Baseline

As of the latest data (Q3 2025/LTM), Atmus generates approximately $1.72 billion in revenue with an EBITDA of roughly $290–300 million (LTM EBITDA reported at $286 million, margins ~17.1%). Earnings Per Share (diluted) is tracking around $2.23 on a trailing basis, though recent quarters suggest a run-rate closer to $2.70. The balance sheet carries roughly $618 million in debt and ~$400 million. The share count stands at approximately 81.5 million. The stock trades near ~$4.7 billion and a P/E of ~24x (trailing) or ~20.5x (forward).

### 3–5 Year Trend & Momentum

The trend shows a business characterized by stability rather than explosive growth. Revenue has compounded at a low-single-digit rate (approx. +3.7% LTM), consistent with a mature industrial supplier. Margins have demonstrated resilience, recovering from ~15.7% EBITDA margin in FY23 to the high-18% range in recent quarters (Q3 2025: 18.9%), indicating effective pricing power and cost management. However, Free Cash Flow has been volatile due to working capital swings (inventory builds), though it is currently trending back upward. The momentum is operationally positive (margins up), but the starting valuation has expanded significantly (price up ~40-60% from spin levels), suggesting the easy gains from "multiple normalization" have already been captured.

## D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”

### Hurdle Definition

To achieve a 2.0x multiplier in 3 years, the stock price must rise from ~$58 to ~$116. This implies a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of roughly 26%. In a mature industry growing at GDP levels, this return cannot come from revenue growth alone. It requires a "double engine" event: EPS must grow significantly (likely >15% annually) _and_ the valuation multiple must expand further (e.g., P/E moving from 20x to 25x+). Without multiple expansion, EPS would need to double to ~$5.40, requiring aggressive margin expansion and massive share buybacks that exceed typical historical limits.

### Anchor Hurdles

For the **P/E anchor**, maintaining the current high multiple of ~21x requires flawless execution; reaching 2x price (~$116) requires ~$5.50 in EPS (a ~100% increase). For the **EV/EBITDA anchor**, if the Enterprise Value doubles, EBITDA would likely need to jump to ~$600 million (from ~$300 million) assuming the multiple holds steady at ~15x, which is historically high for auto parts suppliers. For the **FCF Yield anchor**, to justify a 2.0x price outcome, the business would need to generate roughly $450–$500 million in annual cash flow to offer investors a standard 5% yield, nearly triple the current normalized rate.

### Likely Fundamentals (Company History)

Based on Atmus's track record and the stability of the aftermarket, the "likely" path is far more modest. Revenue growth will likely settle in the 3%–5% range, driven by price and slow volume growth. EBITDA margins have room to stabilize near 19–20%, but unlikely higher given competitive pressures. Share buybacks will likely contribute an additional 2–3% to EPS growth. Consequently, total EPS growth is likely to be in the 8%–12% CAGR range. This would lift EPS from ~$2.70 to roughly $3.80 over three years—solid progress, but far short of the $5.50 required for a fundamental double.

### Likely Fundamentals (Industry Logic)

Industry peers in the filtration and trucking sector (like Donaldson or Cummins) typically trade at 14x–18x forward earnings, not 20x–24x. The "Combustion Engine Discount" is real: as 2030 approaches, institutional capital often rotates out of ICE-exposed names, creating a valuation headwind. While Atmus has a "long tail" due to the aftermarket, it is unlikely the market will award it a tech-like 25x or 30x multiple. Therefore, relying on multiple expansion is imprudent; modest multiple _compression_ is the more logical assumption for a conservative model.

### Required vs Likely Gap (Net Verdict)

Net: Fundamentals imply a likely 1.3x to 1.5x return (driven by ~10% earnings growth and ~1-2% dividend yield); 2x requires conditions—specifically a massive valuation re-rating to ~30x P/E or a sudden doubling of margins—that contradict the reality of a mature, industrial manufacturing business. The gap between the "required" EPS of ~$5.50 and the likely EPS of ~$3.70 is too wide to bridge with operational improvements alone.

## E) Business reality check

### How the business wins

Operationally, Atmus wins by leveraging the "installed base." Every time a Cummins engine is sold, it creates a 10-15 year stream of annuity-like revenue for Atmus fuel and lube filters. To hit the base case, Atmus essentially needs to _not lose_ this position. They must ensure their "first-fit" retention remains high so that fleet managers don't switch to cheaper "will-fit" competitors (white-label brands). Success looks like boring, steady execution: 98%+ on-time delivery to distributors, modest annual price hikes of 2-3% that stick, and using their strong cash flow to slowly buy back stock without levering up the balance sheet.

### Key constraints and failure modes

The primary constraint is the secular decline of diesel. While slow, it caps the "terminal value." If fleet operators stop buying new diesel trucks faster than expected (due to regulations like EPA 2027 or state mandates), the "installed base" stops growing. A more immediate operational risk is the "destocking" cycle. We saw this in FY24—if distributors feel the economy is slowing, they stop ordering filters and burn down their own inventory, causing Atmus’s revenue to dip even if trucks are still driving. Additionally, reliance on Cummins (approx. 15-year contract) is a double-edged sword; they are a guaranteed customer but also a powerful negotiator that limits Atmus's pricing leverage on the first-fit side.

### Why the financial path is plausible / not plausible

The financial path to a _double_ is implausible because it requires the company to act like a high-growth tech stock while operating in a low-growth GDP industrial sector. Incremental margin gains from 17% to 19% are realistic and happening. However, a step-change to 25% margins is unrealistic given the commodity nature of some filtration materials and competitive pricing pressure. The math simply doesn't work for a 2x return unless the starting valuation was significantly lower (e.g., 10x P/E); starting at ~20x P/E leaves no room for error and zero room for the multiple expansion needed to compound price faster than earnings.

## F) Multi-anchor triangulation

### 1. Primary anchor: Price-to-Earnings (P/E)

**Baseline & Reference:**  
The stock currently trades at a forward P/E of ~20.5x and a trailing P/E of ~24x. Historical averages for high-quality industrial peers (like Donaldson) and the broader machinery sector typically range between 15x and 18x. Atmus is currently trading at a premium to this historical band, likely due to post-spin-off optimism and recent margin beats.

**3-Year Driver Inputs:**  
I assume a conservative EPS CAGR of ~9% over the next three years. This is derived from 4% top-line growth, steady margins at ~19%, and a 2% annual share count reduction from buybacks. This projects EPS growing from a normalized run-rate of ~$2.60 today to approximately $3.35 in three years. I also assume the valuation multiple compresses toward the peer mean of 17x as the initial spin-off excitement fades and long-term ICE risks remain.

**Fundamental Multiplier Estimate:**  
Current Price: ~$58.  
Future Price Estimate: ~$57.00.  
Wait, this implies the stock price stays flat or drops? If we are slightly more optimistic and assume the multiple holds at 19x (quality premium), the price becomes ~$63.65.  
math: $64 / $58 ≈ 1.1x.  
Even with solid execution, if the multiple compresses from the current high 24x/20.5x down to a normal 17x-19x, the "P" (Price) struggles to move up even as the "E" (Earnings) grows. The multiplier range is likely **1.0x – 1.2x**.

### 2. Cross-check anchor #1: EV/EBITDA

**Baseline & Reference:**  
Atmus trades at an EV/EBITDA of ~15.8x. This is expensive. Mature auto/truck suppliers often trade closer to 9x–11x, while premium filtration peers might fetch 13x–14x. The current valuation prices in significant growth or a takeover premium.

**3-Year Driver Inputs:**  
I assume EBITDA grows from ~$300M to ~$350M over 3 years (~5% CAGR). This is driven by modest revenue growth and holding margins flat-to-up. Net debt stays roughly constant or decreases slightly as cash is used for buybacks rather than aggressive deleveraging.

**Fundamental Multiplier Estimate:**  
Future EBITDA: $350M.  
Target Multiple: 12x (reverting to a respectable industrial mean).  
Future EV: $350M × 12 = $4,200M.  
Implied Market Cap: $4.7 billion.  
This creates a negative multiplier (~0.8x). If we maintain a bullish 14x multiple:  
Future EV: $350M × 14 = $4,900M.  
Implied Equity Value: $4.5 billion.  
This cross-check is a flashing warning light. It suggests the stock is currently "priced to perfection" or slightly overvalued relative to EBITDA generation capability. The multiplier range here is **0.8x – 1.0x**.

### 3. Cross-check anchor #2: Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield

**Baseline & Reference:**  
Normalized Free Cash Flow is likely around $150M (averaging the bad FY24 and good FY23). On a $4.7B market cap, this is a yield of ~3.2%. Investors in mature industrials typically demand a 4.5%–6.0% FCF yield to compensate for low growth and cyclical risks.

**3-Year Driver Inputs:**  
I assume Cash Flow from Operations grows with EBITDA, and Capital Expenditures remain steady at ~2.5% of sales. This should allow FCF to grow to ~$190M in 3 years.

**Fundamental Multiplier Estimate:**  
Future FCF: $190M.  
Required Yield: 4.5% (a standard "fair value" for a stable industrial).  
Implied Market Cap: $4.22 billion.  
Again, this is below the current market cap of $4.7 billion. For the price to double to ~$116, it would require ~$420M in FCF (nearly triple current levels). Neither is plausible. This confirms the valuation headwind. Multiplier range: **0.9x – 1.1x**.

## G) Valuation sanity check

### Valuation Assessment:

Valuation is a **strong headwind**. Atmus is trading at peak multiples (~24x LTM P/E, ~16x EV/EBITDA) immediately following a period of margin expansion and price appreciation. Historically, automotive and heavy-truck suppliers revert to single-digit or low-double-digit multiples once the "growth" phase of a cycle slows. Paying >20x earnings for a company with 4% revenue growth exposed to the internal combustion engine is aggressive. A reasonable band for this stock is 14x–17x P/E.

### Conservative Multiplier Range:

Correcting for this overvaluation significantly dampens the 3-year outlook. Even if the business performs well (earnings up ~30% total over 3 years), the contraction in the multiple (from ~21x forward to ~16x) will eat almost all those gains.  
Calculation: (1.30x Growth) × (0.76x Valuation De-rating) ≈ 0.99x.  
Therefore, a conservative 3-year valuation multiplier range is **0.90x – 1.25x**. This implies the stock is likely "dead money" or a slow compounder (dividends + slight buybacks) rather than a capital appreciation play.

## H) Final answer

### Most Likely 3-Year Price Multiplier: 1.1x – 1.3x

The most likely outcome is that Atmus Filtration performs steadily as a business but treads water as a stock. While fundamentals (EPS) are expected to grow at a respectable 8-10% CAGR driven by aftermarket resilience and share buybacks, the current valuation (P/E ~20.5x, EV/EBITDA ~16x) is stretched. As the multiple inevitably compresses toward the industrial mean of ~15-17x, it will offset the majority of the earnings growth. Investors will likely receive a total return closer to 5-8% annually (including dividends), resulting in a price multiplier far below the 2.0x target.

### Bull Case Multiplier: ~1.6x

For the stock to perform better, the market must maintain the current premium valuation (preventing multiple compression) while Atmus executes a "perfect" margin expansion story—pushing EBITDA margins above 20% and deploying all excess cash into aggressive buybacks. Additionally, the macro environment would need to remain robust (no trucking recession) to support volume growth at the high end (5%+). In this scenario, EPS grows to ~$4.80, but this requires ignoring the secular risks of electrification that typically cap valuations in this sector.

### Verdict: Unlikely

Reaching 2.0x in 3 years is not realistically achievable under conservative assumptions; it would require the stock to trade at ~30x earnings or for earnings to double, neither of which fits the mature, low-growth profile of the business.

### Monitoring Metrics:

**Quarterly Aftermarket Revenue Growth %** (must stay >3%);  
**EBITDA Margin %** (must hold >18%);  
**Free Cash Flow Conversion %** (target >80% of Net Income);  
**Net Debt / EBITDA Ratio** (stay &lt;2.0x);  
**Share Count Reduction** (track annualized % decline);  
**Book-to-Bill Ratio** (if available, proxy for demand health);  
**Gross Margin %** (watch for input cost inflation).
