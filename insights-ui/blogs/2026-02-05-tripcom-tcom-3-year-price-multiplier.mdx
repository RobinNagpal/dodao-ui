## **A) Anchor selection**

For Trip.com Group (TCOM) today, the best **PRIMARY anchor is P/FCF (price-to-free-cash-flow) on a normalized basis**, because this is an asset-light online travel platform where long-run shareholder value is primarily driven by how much cash the platform can generate after marketing, product investment, and modest capex. In FY 2024, Trip.com generated **~CNY 19.0B** of free cash flow on **~CNY 53.3B** of revenue (a **~36% FCF margin**) while capex was only **~CNY 0.6B**, which is exactly the profile where cash generation is the clearest “truth metric.” This anchor is more suitable than EV/EBITDA as the primary lens because EBITDA can understate the cash reality when working capital and investment income swing, and it is more suitable than P/E because reported earnings can be distorted by non-operating gains (your Q3 2025 net income is unusually high due to large non-operating income), while free cash flow—over a full cycle—better captures what management can return via buybacks/dividends or reinvest at high ROI.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #1 is EV/EBIT (or EV/EBITDA as a close cousin)**, because it is the cleanest way to compare Trip.com to global OTA peers and to judge whether the market is paying a reasonable price for the company’s core operating profit before the impact of cash balances and capital structure. This cross-check is especially informative when the company holds large net cash, because EV-based multiples naturally “credit” that cash by reducing enterprise value, which is important for Trip.com given its substantial net cash position (FY 2024 net cash **~CNY 36.6B**, rising to **~CNY 48.5B** by Q3 2025). EV/EBIT also keeps the analysis grounded in operating performance: if operating margins are sustainable, EBIT should compound with revenue and take-rate gains, and the multiple should stay within a sensible band even if accounting items fluctuate.

My **CROSS-CHECK anchor #2 is EV/Sales**, because it catches the most common OTA risk blind-spot: revenue can grow quickly during travel recoveries, but the _quality_ of that revenue depends on take rates, competitive intensity, and how much of gross profit must be reinvested into marketing to defend share. EV/Sales forces you to ask, “If the market is paying ~4–6× sales, what operating margin and reinvestment intensity is it implicitly assuming?”—which matters here because Trip.com’s gross margin is high (FY 2024 **~81%**), but competitive pressure (Meituan in hotels, direct airline/rail channels in ticketing) can push marketing and incentives up, compressing EBIT and FCF even if reported revenue looks strong. This second check is necessary because it helps prevent overconfidence in a single “cash-rich, high-margin” year that might not fully represent a normalized competitive equilibrium.

## **B) The 3–4 driver framework**

**Driver 1: Core travel demand and revenue growth (especially accommodation and air/rail volumes).** For Trip.com, revenue is the clearest top-of-funnel indicator of booking activity and platform monetization, and it links directly to both EV/Sales and EV/EBIT because, with a relatively stable cost structure, incremental revenue tends to create operating leverage. The numeric baseline is FY 2024 revenue of **~CNY 53.3B**, up **~20%** year over year, following the post-reopening step-change in FY 2023 (revenue **~CNY 44.5B**, up **~122%**). That history matters because it shows two different regimes: a one-time rebound surge (2023) and a more normal growth year (2024), so a conservative forward view should lean closer to the 2024 growth rate than the 2023 snapback.

**Driver 2: Operating margin durability (EBIT/EBITDA margin).** In an OTA model, the key question is not “can demand grow?” but “how much of that demand becomes durable profit after marketing, product, and service costs,” especially when competition intensifies. Trip.com’s FY 2024 EBIT margin was **~26.6%** and EBITDA margin **~28.2%**, broadly similar to FY 2023 (EBIT margin **~25.4%**), which suggests margins are not just a one-quarter artifact but a post-recovery operating level. This driver impacts EV/EBIT and P/FCF directly: if margins hold while revenue grows, EBIT and operating cash generation can compound faster than revenue; if margins compress due to higher customer acquisition costs or supplier bargaining power, the same revenue growth yields much less per-share value.

**Driver 3: Free cash flow conversion and capital allocation (FCF margin, buybacks/dividends, and net cash).** Trip.com’s FY 2024 free cash flow was **~CNY 19.0B** (FCF margin **~36%**), and it also has meaningful net cash, so the company can choose between reinvesting in growth, buying back shares, or paying dividends without stressing the balance sheet. This matters for the primary P/FCF anchor because the stock’s “intrinsic compounding” is driven by FCF **per share**; it also matters for EV-based anchors because rising net cash reduces enterprise value, meaning the equity can rise even if operating multiples do not expand. The reason this driver is central for Trip.com is that OTA platforms can generate significant cash in good demand environments, but that cash is only truly “owner earnings” if it is not fully competed away via marketing wars or permanently required as incentive spend to maintain share.

**Driver 4: Share count and per-share translation (dilution vs buybacks).** Because the stock price is a per-share claim on cash flows, even strong business growth can fail to produce 2× outcomes if share count rises meaningfully. Trip.com’s shares outstanding have drifted upward from **~601M (FY 2020)** to **~654M (FY 2024)**, and FY 2024 shows **~2.6%** share increase, which is not extreme but is large enough that it can shave several points off per-share compounding if it persists. This driver ties directly to all three anchors: revenue, EBIT, and FCF must be evaluated **per share**, and the net cash “credit” also matters per share because building net cash while issuing shares can dilute the benefit.

## **C) Baseline snapshot**

Using your provided “current” snapshot, TCOM is around **$62** with **~653.6M shares** and a market cap of **~$39.5B**, with a trailing P/E of **~9.7×** and a forward P/E of **~14.7×**, plus a small dividend yield of about **~0.5%**. On fundamentals (FY 2024), Trip.com produced **~CNY 53.3B** of revenue, **~CNY 15.0B** EBITDA, **~CNY 14.2B** EBIT, and **~CNY 19.0B** free cash flow, while holding substantial net cash (FY 2024 net cash **~CNY 36.6B**, rising to **~CNY 48.5B** by Q3 2025). The “current quarter” profitability line items in your data include very large non-operating income in Q3 2025 (other non-operating income **~CNY 15.7B**), so a conservative baseline should treat FY 2024 operating profitability as the more reliable anchor for normalized earning power rather than extrapolating that quarter.

Over the last five years, the trend shows a clear post-COVID normalization and then a surge, followed by a more normal growth year: revenue fell in FY 2020 and then stabilized around **~CNY 20B** in FY 2021–FY 2022 before jumping to **~CNY 44.5B** in FY 2023 and **~CNY 53.3B** in FY 2024. Profitability followed the same pattern: EBIT was negative in FY 2020–FY 2021, near break-even in FY 2022, and then structurally higher in FY 2023–FY 2024 with EBIT margins in the **~25–27%** range, while free cash flow turned strongly positive and stayed high (FY 2023 FCF **~CNY 21.4B**, FY 2024 FCF **~CNY 19.0B**). The key implication is that Trip.com has regained operating leverage and cash generation power, but the extraordinary rebound rates of FY 2023 are not a conservative base for the next three years; the more relevant baseline is that it is now a high-margin, high-cash platform growing off a normalized travel demand level.

## **D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”**

A stock **2× in 3 years** implies roughly **~26% per year** compounding, because “~1.26× per year ≈ ~2.0× over 3 years.” In a “broadly similar” travel and macro regime, that kind of return usually requires that **per-share** fundamentals (FCF per share or EPS per share) compound at a very high rate and/or that the valuation multiple expands meaningfully; relying on multiple expansion alone is not conservative because multiples are sentiment-sensitive and can compress even when the business performs. For Trip.com specifically, the per-share lens matters because the company has had modest dilution historically, and even a few percent annual share growth meaningfully raises the bar for per-share doubling.

Under the **primary P/FCF** anchor, 2× in 3 years is straightforward in logic: if the P/FCF multiple stays flat, then **FCF per share must roughly double**, which means something close to **~26% per year** FCF/share growth; if FCF/share grows only **~1.5×** (about “mid-teens per year”), then you would need the valuation multiple to expand about **~1.3×** to reach 2×, which is not impossible but is not the conservative default. Under **EV/EBIT**, if the multiple is stable, then **EBIT per share must nearly double**; if EBIT per share grows **~1.4× to ~1.6×**, then you again need some combination of multiple expansion and/or a rising net-cash credit (enterprise value falling relative to equity value) to close the gap. Under **EV/Sales**, a 2× outcome requires either very strong revenue-per-share growth (hard to sustain at rebound-era rates) or a meaningful improvement in EBIT margin and cash conversion such that the market is willing to pay a higher EV/Sales multiple; because EV/Sales is most sensitive to margin durability, the “must be true” condition is that competition does not force a higher marketing take that permanently reduces margin.

Based on Trip.com’s own history, a conservative “most likely” range for the next three years is **~8–12% annual revenue growth**, because FY 2024 already shows a normalized growth rate (**~20%**) after the one-time FY 2023 rebound (**~122%**), and travel platforms typically revert toward high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth once demand is normalized rather than continuing rebound-like acceleration. For margins, the most likely outcome is **stable to slightly lower EBIT margins around ~24–27%**, because the company is already operating at a high margin level (FY 2024 EBIT margin **~26.6%**) and further large margin expansion is harder when competition is active and marketing is a strategic weapon. For cash conversion, a conservative assumption is that FCF remains strong but normalizes below the very highest year, so **~25–35% FCF margin** is a reasonable band versus FY 2024’s **~36%**, and with share count drifting **~0–2% per year** (given past ~2–3% increases but some buybacks), that maps to roughly **~10–18% annual FCF per share growth** in a base case rather than the ~26% needed for a clean per-share double.

Industry and business-position logic supports that moderation: online travel is structurally growing, but it is also competitively contested, and Trip.com’s strongest moat is in China where it has scale and a multi-brand portfolio; the flip side is that domestic rivals can subsidize travel through super-app ecosystems, which tends to cap take-rate expansion and can force higher promotion spend. Transportation ticketing is strategically important but thin-margin, so the company’s earnings power is disproportionately dependent on accommodation and higher-value services, meaning growth quality matters more than headline bookings. That makes “mid-teens per-share compounding” plausible if Trip.com keeps a high share in premium travel and uses Skyscanner and Trip.com brand to improve international mix, but it makes “high-20s per-share compounding for three straight years” a higher bar unless there is an unusually benign competitive environment or a meaningful step-up in buybacks funded by surplus cash.

Comparing required vs likely across anchors highlights a consistent gap. On **P/FCF**, 2× wants roughly **~2.0×** FCF/share (or ~1.6× plus a meaningful rerating), while the likely fundamental path looks closer to **~1.3× to ~1.7×** FCF/share over three years in a conservative regime; that implies 2× would require either unusually strong growth (closer to rebound-era economics) or a sustained valuation tailwind. On **EV/EBIT**, the same logic holds: stable multiples with **~1.3× to ~1.6×** EBIT/share growth does not usually become 2× unless net cash builds sharply per share and/or the multiple expands. On **EV/Sales**, a 2× outcome is hard without either a return to rebound-like growth or a clear margin step-up, and the company already operates at high gross margin, so further margin gains are more likely to be competed away than to drop straight to the bottom line. **Net: fundamentals imply ~1.4× to ~1.8×; 2× requires unusually strong per-share cash growth plus either aggressive buybacks or a rerating that is above what a “similar regime” assumption comfortably supports.**

## **E) Business reality check**

To hit the base-case driver ranges, Trip.com must keep the flywheel working: it needs accommodation growth to remain strong (because it is the highest-margin core), use transportation primarily as a high-frequency funnel that increases app engagement, and expand packaged tours and corporate travel in ways that raise wallet share without relying on heavy discounting. Operationally, that means maintaining supplier relationships and inventory depth in China’s higher-tier markets (where Ctrip is strongest), improving conversion and personalization (so marketing dollars translate into repeat bookings), and growing international and outbound travel mix through Trip.com and Skyscanner so that revenue growth is not solely dependent on domestic cycles. Financially, it must protect operating margin by scaling service and tech costs slower than revenue, which is consistent with its FY 2023–FY 2024 operating margins holding around the mid-20s even as revenue expanded.

The main constraints and failure modes map cleanly to the drivers. If Meituan and other super-app competitors intensify subsidy behavior in hotels, customer acquisition costs can rise and compress EBIT/FCF even if revenue grows, breaking the margin and cash conversion drivers and lowering EV/EBIT and P/FCF outcomes. If airlines, rail operators, and direct channels push harder on direct booking with loyalty perks, Trip.com’s transportation segment could remain high-volume but become an even lower-profit funnel, forcing more monetization pressure on accommodation and packages. Macro cyclicality is also real: travel demand is discretionary, and a softer consumer environment would slow revenue growth while fixed cost leverage works in reverse, which is why it is not conservative to underwrite rebound-like growth. Finally, per-share outcomes can disappoint if share count continues rising a few percent per year; even a strong business can struggle to deliver a 2× stock if shareholders’ claim is being diluted.

When you reconcile the business logic with the numbers, the base-case path looks plausible as incremental execution because Trip.com has already shown it can operate at high margins and generate substantial free cash flow with modest capex in FY 2024. What looks less plausible as a conservative baseline is the “2× hurdle,” because it typically requires either sustained high-teens to 20%+ per-share cash growth for three years or a meaningful rerating; both outcomes can happen, but they are more consistent with either an unusually favorable competitive period or a deliberate capital return shift (large buybacks funded by net cash build) rather than the steady-state OTA economics implied by a “similar regime” assumption.

## **F) Multi-anchor triangulation**

### **Primary anchor**

On the **P/FCF** anchor, the baseline metric is FY 2024 free cash flow of **~CNY 19.0B**, which is exceptionally high relative to revenue (**~36% FCF margin**) and indicates strong cash generation capacity in a normalized travel environment. The valuation reference point from your data is that FY 2024 was associated with a **P/FCF around ~17×** (and an FCF yield around **~5–6%**), while today’s snapshot shows the stock price has come down versus the FY 2024 close, suggesting the market is not paying an obviously euphoric cash-flow multiple. The per-share baseline is anchored by **~654M shares**, which means the growth question must be framed as FCF **per share**, not just total FCF.

For the next three years, the driver inputs I use are: revenue growth **~8–12% per year** (conservative vs the rebound year and consistent with a mature OTA leader); stable-to-slightly-lower operating margins (because competition tends to cap margin expansion once a platform is already highly profitable); and FCF margin **~25–35%** (still strong, but allowing for normalization versus a peak cash year). I also assume share count change of **~0–2% per year**, because the company has historically shown modest dilution but also has the cash capacity to offset it through buybacks if management prioritizes per-share outcomes. These inputs are reasonable because the business is already at scale, so growth is more likely to be steady compounding than step-change, and the largest swing factor is not capex but competitive marketing intensity.

If revenue compounds at **~8–12% per year**, that is roughly **~1.26× to ~1.40×** over three years; if FCF margin holds broadly stable, total FCF can grow in a similar range, and after modest dilution, FCF **per share** might compound to roughly **~1.2× to ~1.6×**. With a roughly stable P/FCF multiple, that implies a similar **~1.2× to ~1.6×** price outcome from fundamentals alone, and if valuation adds a modest tailwind (for example, the market regains confidence that cash generation is durable and rewards it with a somewhat higher multiple), the total could plausibly reach **~1.4× to ~1.9×**. The low end happens if competition forces higher incentives and the FCF margin falls toward the mid-20s; the high end happens if management uses net cash to reduce share count and keeps FCF margins closer to the low-30s while revenue compounds steadily.

### **Cross-check anchor #1**

On the **EV/EBIT** anchor, the baseline metric is FY 2024 EBIT of **~CNY 14.2B** with an EBIT margin of **~26.6%**, which is already a “high-quality margin” level for a global OTA platform. The valuation reference point in your dataset shows EV-based multiples for FY 2024 in the high-teens to ~20× range (EV/EBITDA **~20×** in the FY 2024 ratios), while the more recent snapshot shows EV/EBITDA has at times printed lower (mid-teens), consistent with the idea that the market multiple has not expanded even as earnings recovered. The EV framing is important because Trip.com has meaningful net cash, so enterprise value is effectively “market cap minus net cash,” which means building net cash per share can boost equity returns even if operating multiples are flat.

For the next three years, my inputs are: revenue growth **~8–12% per year**, EBIT margin **~24–27%** (roughly stable, allowing for mild pressure), and a modest improvement in net cash per share (because the company has historically generated strong free cash flow and capex is small). I keep multiple expansion conservative, assuming the EV/EBIT (or EV/EBITDA) multiple is broadly stable in a similar regime, because a rerating requires a durable confidence shift on China/competition/geopolitical discount factors that is not guaranteed. These inputs align with both company history (post-reopening margins already high) and industry logic (OTAs tend to face competitive marketing cycles that limit continuous margin expansion).

If revenue grows **~1.26× to ~1.40×** over three years and EBIT margin stays near the mid-20s, EBIT should also grow roughly **~1.25× to ~1.45×**, and after small dilution the per-share EBIT growth might be **~1.20× to ~1.40×**. With a stable EV/EBIT multiple, enterprise value would track that range, and the equity can do somewhat better if net cash per share rises (because EV can stay flatter than market cap as cash accumulates). That yields a conservative EV/EBIT-implied equity multiplier of roughly **~1.3× to ~1.8×**, where the low end corresponds to margin pressure and weaker outbound travel mix, and the high end corresponds to stable margins plus meaningful net cash build and/or buybacks improving per-share translation.

### **Cross-check anchor #2**

On the **EV/Sales** anchor, the baseline metric is FY 2024 revenue of **~CNY 53.3B** and very high gross margin (**~81%**), which tells you the platform has pricing power in commissions and can monetize demand efficiently—provided marketing does not re-absorb those gains. The valuation reference points in your data show EV/Sales around the mid-single digits (FY 2024 EV/Sales **~5.6×**, and more recent snapshots nearer **~4× to ~5×**), which means the market is already capitalizing Trip.com as a high-margin platform rather than a low-quality travel intermediary. This anchor is sensitive to whether the market believes the current margin structure is sustainable under competitive pressure, so it is a good check on “too-optimistic cash” assumptions.

The three-year inputs here are: revenue growth **~8–12% per year** and a steady gross margin, with operating margin stable to slightly down if marketing competition heats up. I assume EV/Sales multiple is roughly stable in a similar regime, because multiple expansion on sales usually requires either sustained above-trend growth or a visible structural improvement in profitability; Trip.com is already operating at high margins, so the “easy” profitability gains from recovery have largely been captured. I also keep share count drift modest, because EV/Sales is not inherently per-share, but the equity outcome still depends on whether growth accrues to each share or is diluted.

With **~1.26× to ~1.40×** revenue growth over three years and a stable EV/Sales multiple, enterprise value would also move roughly **~1.26× to ~1.40×**; equity could land a bit above that if net cash rises meaningfully per share, but it could land below if margin pressure causes the market to de-rate EV/Sales. Practically, this cross-check implies a fundamental multiplier of roughly **~1.2× to ~1.7×**, where the low end reflects weaker growth plus competitive pressure that compresses the multiple (even with revenue growth), and the high end reflects steady growth with sustained margin credibility and ongoing net cash accumulation.

---

## **G) Valuation sanity check**

Valuation is **more likely neutral-to-mild tailwind than headwind**, because your provided multiples suggest the market is currently not paying peak-cycle prices for Trip.com’s earnings power. The “current” snapshot shows a trailing P/E of **~9.7×**, while FY 2024 ratios show a meaningfully higher P/E (**~19×**) at that time, which implies that earnings have risen faster than price (or that the multiple has compressed), leaving the stock less “valuation-stretched” than it was when the market capitalized the initial recovery. On EV-based measures, FY 2024 EV/EBITDA near **~20×** versus more recent readings in the mid-teens suggests that a rerating back toward its own recent history is possible if investors gain confidence that margins and cash flows are durable and not a temporary post-reopening peak.

A conservative valuation-multiplier range over three years is **~0.9× to ~1.2×**, meaning multiples could compress a bit if growth slows or China risk premium rises, or expand modestly if the market becomes more confident about normalized growth and cash returns. The reason this band fits a “similar regime” assumption is that OTAs are cyclical and sentiment-sensitive, so you should not bank on a large rerating, but the starting point appears more discounted than euphoric, which leaves room for modest multiple recovery without requiring a regime change.

---

## **H) Final answer**

The **most likely** 3-year price multiplier for Trip.com (TCOM) is **~1.4× to ~1.8×**, because a conservative combination of **~8–12% revenue growth**, broadly stable operating margins in the mid-20s, strong cash conversion, and modest per-share dilution tends to compound per-share cash earnings in the low-to-mid teens annually, with valuation acting as a small swing factor rather than the main engine.

The **bull-case** multiplier range is **~1.8× to ~2.3×**, and it requires that Trip.com sustains growth closer to the high end of the range while keeping marketing intensity under control so EBIT and FCF margins stay near FY 2024 levels, and that management actively improves per-share outcomes via buybacks funded by its large net cash generation; in that scenario, per-share free cash flow can approach the “~2× in 3 years” neighborhood, and even a modest valuation recovery toward its own recent history can push the stock across the 2× line.

**Borderline.** Monitor quarterly revenue growth (%); accommodation segment revenue growth (%) and implied take rate (commission revenue as % of accommodation GMV, if disclosed); transportation revenue growth (%) and contribution margin trend (bps); adjusted operating margin or EBIT margin (%); sales & marketing as % of revenue (%); free cash flow (CNY) and FCF margin (%); net cash (CNY) and net cash per share (CNY/share); shares outstanding (M) and net buyback/dilution rate (%); ADR EPS (trailing 4Q, $/share) and EPS growth (%); Skyscanner/Trip.com international revenue share (%) or outbound booking mix (%).
