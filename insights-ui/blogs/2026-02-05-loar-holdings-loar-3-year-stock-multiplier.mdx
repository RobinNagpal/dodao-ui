## A) Anchor selection

**Primary Anchor: Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)** \
EV/EBITDA is the definitive valuation metric for high-growth, serial acquirers in the aerospace defense sector like Loar Holdings. This metric is superior to P/E for Loar because the company’s strategy involves aggressive M&A, resulting in significant non-cash depreciation and amortization (D&A) charges that artificially depress GAAP net income and earnings per share. By focusing on EBITDA, we isolate the core cash-generating profitability of the underlying operations and the acquired entities before accounting/capital structure distortions. Given that Loar trades on its ability to arbitrate private market valuations against public market premiums, EBITDA provides the clearest view of the "acquisition currency" the company uses.

**Cross-Check Anchor #1: Free Cash Flow (FCF) Yield** \
While EBITDA measures operating profit, FCF Yield serves as the critical reality check on whether that profit is actually converting to usable cash. For a company like Loar, growing EBITDA is meaningless if working capital drag (inventory buildup) or high interest expenses consume the liquidity needed for further deal-making and debt service. This anchor is particularly informative right now because Loar is in a rapid scaling phase; if the disparity between Adjusted EBITDA and FCF widens, it signals low quality of earnings or integration issues. FCF per share growth ultimately drives the long-term compounding of intrinsic value, making this a necessary "truth serum" against a lofty EBITDA multiple.

**Cross-Check Anchor #2: EV-to-Sales (Revenue Multiple)** \
We utilize EV-to-Sales as a secondary risk gauge to detect overheating in growth expectations. When EBITDA margins are high (Loar operates at ~35%+), investors often overlook the ceiling on how much efficiency can be squeezed from a dollar of revenue. If the EV/EBITDA multiple is high but EV/Sales is moderate, it suggests margin expansion potential; however, Loar currently trades at a double-digit revenue multiple (>14x), implying that the market has already priced in perfection regarding both growth and margin sustainability. This anchor protects against the risk of margin compression—if margins revert to industry means, the EBITDA multiple compresses, and the Revenue multiple exposes the valuation risk.

## B) The 3–4 driver framework

**Driver 1: Organic Revenue Growth & Pricing Power** \
The first critical driver is the ability to sustain organic growth above the industry average through pricing power on proprietary aftermarket parts. Loar operates in a niche where 75% of revenue comes from commercial and business aviation, heavily skewed toward the aftermarket where pricing is inelastic. Historically, successful peers like TransDigm achieve 4-6% volume growth plus 3-5% price increases. For Loar to justify its valuation, it must demonstrate it can replicate this "price-plus-volume" algorithm, targeting high-single-digit to low-double-digit organic growth (8-12%). If organic growth dips below 5%, the premium multiple collapses.

**Driver 2: EBITDA Margin Expansion** \
The second driver is the expansion of Adjusted EBITDA margins from the current ~35% baseline toward the mid-40% range. This "Loarization" of acquired assets involves cutting costs and optimizing pricing at newly bought subsidiaries. The business model relies on the assumption that Loar can run these businesses more profitably than their previous private owners. With a gross margin exceeding 50%, the ceiling is high, but as they integrate larger acquisitions, maintaining this operational discipline is the key to converting revenue growth into exponential EBITDA growth.

**Driver 3: Capital Deployment (M&A) Velocity** \
The third driver is the pace and quality of capital deployment. Loar is an acquisition platform; its thesis depends on buying companies at ~10-12x EBITDA and trading at ~40x EBITDA, creating immediate accretive value (multiple arbitrage). The driver here is the volume of acquired EBITDA (aiming for 50M acquired annually) without diluting shareholders excessively or over-leveraging the balance sheet. This driver directly impacts the "S" (Share count) and "EV" (Enterprise Value) in our anchors, as issuing equity at today’s high valuation to buy cheaper assets is a powerful lever for per-share growth.

**Driver 4: Cash Conversion Ratio** \
The final driver is the conversion of Adjusted EBITDA into Free Cash Flow. Currently, the company’s FCF margin has fluctuated (17-21% in recent quarters vs ~35% EBITDA margins) due to interest payments and working capital investments. To support the debt needed for acquisitions and justify the current stock price, Loar must improve its cash conversion ratio. We are looking for FCF to approach 60-70% of EBITDA over the 3-year period. Poor conversion would force the company to rely entirely on expensive equity or high-yield debt for growth, damaging the per-share compounding math.

## C) Baseline snapshot

**Current Baseline (TTM/Recent Quarters)** \
Based on the latest data (Q2/Q3 2025 and FY2024), Loar Holdings generates trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue of approximately $475 million. Adjusted EBITDA is running at an annualized rate of roughly 180 million, reflecting a robust EBITDA margin of ~35-36%. The company holds a net debt position of roughly $190 million, which is conservative relative to its equity value but typical for a company recently public and ready to lever up. The share count stands at approximately 94 million shares. Crucially, the stock trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of ~41x and an EV/Sales multiple of ~14x, pricing it at the absolute top end of the aerospace valuation spectrum.

**3-5 Year Trend & Momentum** \
The trendline shows aggressive top-line expansion, with revenue growth exceeding 25% year-over-year, driven by a combination of recovering commercial aerospace volumes and active M&A. Gross margins have remained resilient above 50%, signaling strong pricing power despite inflationary pressures. However, operating leverage has been mixed; while EBITDA grows in absolute dollars, EBITDA margins have hovered in the mid-30s rather than marching strictly upward, partially due to transaction costs and public company expenses. The trajectory implies strong business momentum, but the "step-change" in operating leverage required to justify the valuation has not yet fully materialized in the printed financials.

## D) “2× Hurdle vs Likely Path”

**Hurdle Definition: What 2× Requires** \
To double the stock price to ~350M. If the valuation multiple compresses to a more standard "compounder" premium of 25x, EBITDA must roughly triple to ~$540M (a 45% CAGR). In short, 2× requires either perfect market sentiment retention or explosive, error-free fundamental growth.

**Anchor Hurdles: The "Must Be True"** \
For the Primary Anchor (EV/EBITDA) to support a double, Loar must maintain a >35x multiple while growing EBITDA >20% annually. History shows that as niche acquirers scale, multiples often compress toward 20-25x. For the Cross-Check (FCF Yield), the current yield is tight (~1.2%). To double the price and offer a healthy 3-4% FCF yield in year 3, FCF per share must grow nearly 4x from today's levels. This implies the company must stop "buying" growth and start "harvesting" it, which contradicts the M&A growth thesis.

**Likely Fundamentals (Company History)** \
Based on Loar’s history and the "Mini-TransDigm" playbook, the most likely path for the next 3 years involves organic growth of 8-10% (price + volume) and acquired growth contributing another 10-15%. This suggests a total revenue CAGR of ~20-22%. EBITDA margins likely expand modestly to ~38% as scale benefits kick in. Consequently, EBITDA growth will likely land in the 20-25% CAGR range. This is excellent performance, but it falls short of the >40% CAGR required to offset meaningful multiple compression.

**Likely Fundamentals (Industry/Market Logic)** \
The aerospace supply chain is currently constrained, which supports pricing power (good for margins) but limits volume recovery (bad for organic growth). While Loar has a strong moat in proprietary parts, the industry logic suggests that maintaining a 40x EBITDA multiple is an anomaly reserved for small, hyper-growth phases or market manias. As Loar crosses $1B in EV and beyond, peer gravitation takes over. Established peers like Heico and TransDigm trade at premiums (30-35x), but rarely sustain >40x for extended periods without volatility.

**Net Gap: Required vs. Likely** \
Comparing the required trajectory to the likely path reveals a disconnect. The "required" path for a 2x return demands ~26% growth _with_ static multiples, or ~45% growth with compressing multiples. The "likely" fundamental path delivers ~22-25% growth. \
**Net: fundamentals imply ~1.4× to ~1.6×; 2× requires Z conditions (sustained 40x+ multiple) that are above history/industry/business reality.**

## E) Business reality check

**How the Business Wins** \
Operationally, Loar wins by acting as a consolidation machine in a fragmented market. To hit the base case, they must successfully integrate 3-4 medium-sized acquisitions annually without disrupting operations. They need to push price increases of 4-6% annually to their airline and OEM customers without triggering a backlash or "de-stocking" event. Furthermore, they must leverage their "sole-source" position to force customers to accept longer lead times or higher prices, effectively transferring inflation to the customer. The successful execution of this pricing strategy in the aftermarket is the single biggest operational lever they have.

**Key Constraints and Failure Modes** \
The primary constraint is the availability of targets at attractive valuations. Private equity is actively hunting the same aerospace assets, potentially driving private multiples up to 14-15x EBITDA, which shrinks Loar's arbitrage spread and accretion. Additionally, supply chain labor shortages can delay shipments; if Loar misses delivery windows on critical parts, they risk damaging relationships with key OEMs like Boeing or Airbus. Financially, the "failure mode" is a rise in interest rates or a credit crunch that prevents them from raising the debt capital needed to fund the M&A leg of their stool.

**Why the Financial Path is Plausible (But Not Easy)** \
The path to strong growth is plausible because the demand for air travel (and thus spare parts) is secular and long-term. Loar does not need to invent new products; they just need to supply existing ones. However, the path to a _doubling_ share price is strained because it requires "step-change execution"—meaning they must accelerate M&A pace significantly above their historical average while the stock is priced for perfection. The business logic is sound, but the valuation leaves zero margin of safety for operational hiccups.

## F) Multi-anchor triangulation

### 1. Primary Anchor: EV/EBITDA

**Baseline & Reference:** \
Loar currently trades at a forward Adjusted EV/EBITDA of ~41x (based on annualized recent quarters). This is a significant premium to the broader aerospace defense index (~15-18x) and even a premium to "compounder" peers like TransDigm (~30-35x) and Heico (~40-50x). The market is pricing Loar as a nascent, faster-growing version of these giants.

**3-Year Driver Inputs:** \
We assume Loar grows revenue at a 20% CAGR (Organic + M&A) reaching ~310M. This represents a robust ~72% increase in absolute EBITDA over 3 years. These assumptions are aggressive but consistent with a well-executed "buy-and-build" strategy.

**Multiplier Estimate:** \
If Year 3 EBITDA is $310M, we must apply a terminal multiple. Expecting the multiple to remain at 41x is imprudent. A conservative yet respectful multiple for a compounder of this quality is ~28x-30x. \
_Math:_ $310M EBITDA x 30x Multiple = 8.9B. \
Less $2.5B debt (assuming net debt rises to 400M due to acquisitions) leaves ~6.4B. \
$8.9B / $6.4B = **~1.39x multiplier.** \
_Upside/Downside:_ If the multiple holds at 40x, the multiplier is ~1.9x. If it compresses to 20x, the stock is dead money (flat).

### 2. Cross-check anchor #1: P/FCF (Free Cash Flow)

**Baseline & Reference:** \
The current FCF yield is roughly 1.0% - 1.3% (Price/FCF of ~80x). This is extremely rich. Investors are accepting negligible cash yield today for the promise of massive future cash generation. For context, mature industrial compounders typically trade at 3-4% FCF yield (25x-33x P/FCF).

**3-Year Driver Inputs:** \
We assume Cash Flow Conversion improves. By Year 3, we target FCF to be roughly 60% of EBITDA (after interest and tax), which is typical for efficient operators. Using the 310M EBITDA anchor, that implies ~$186M. We assume the share count dilutes by ~2-3% annually to fund deals, reaching ~100M shares. \
_Math:_ $186M FCF / 100M shares = $1.86 FCF/share.

**Multiplier Estimate:** \
Applying a growth-oriented P/FCF multiple of 35x (roughly 2.8% yield) to $1.86 implies ~$65. This is _below_ the current price. Even applying a heico-like 50x P/FCF gives ~$93/share. \
_Multiplier:_ $93 / $68 = **~1.36x multiplier.** \
This anchor highlights the risk: The current price is disconnected from near-term cash flow realities, heavily relying on EBITDA growth and multiple expansion rather than cash delivery.

### 3. Cross-check anchor #2: EV/Sales

**Baseline & Reference:** \
Loar trades at ~14.5x EV/Sales. This is a software-like multiple for a hardware business. High-margin hardware businesses typically top out at 8x-10x unless they are in a hyper-growth phase.

**3-Year Driver Inputs:** \
Using the same aggressive revenue forecast of ~$820M in Year 3 (20% CAGR). We assume the market "derisks" the valuation as the law of large numbers sets in, compressing the sales multiple.

**Multiplier Estimate:** \
If the EV/Sales multiple compresses to a still-premium 10x: \
_Math:_ $820M Revenue x 10x = $8.2B Enterprise Value. \
Less $400M Debt = $7.8B Equity. \
$7.8B / $6.4B = **~1.21x multiplier.** \
If the multiple holds at 14x (highly unlikely as growth slows from 25% to 20%): $11.5B EV -> ~1.7x multiplier. \
This anchor confirms that ~2.0x requires maintaining an outlier valuation on a larger revenue base, which is statistically rare.

## G) Valuation sanity check

**Valuation Assessment** \
Valuation is a distinct **headwind**. Trading at >40x EBITDA and >14x Sales, LOAR is priced for perfection. A "similar regime" does not imply that an outlier multiple stays an outlier forever; it implies mean reversion toward the high end of the peer group. The peer group (TransDigm, Heico) has earned its premium over decades; Loar is being awarded that premium upfront. Any operational slip—a missed quarter, an integration headache, or a slowdown in organic growth—could cause the multiple to contract 20-30% rapidly, wiping out gains from fundamental growth.

**Conservative Multiplier Range** \
Combining the aggressive fundamental growth (20% CAGR) with a logical normalization of valuation multiples (compression from ~41x to ~30x EBITDA), the mathematics suggest a total return far lower than the operational growth rate. \
**Conservative Range:** 1.25× – 1.55× over 3 years. \
This reflects a scenario where the business executes beautifully (EBITDA nearly doubles) but the stock price only rises ~40% because the valuation multiple normalizes.

## H) Final answer

**Most Likely 3-Year Price Multiplier: 1.3× – 1.6×** \
The most likely outcome is that Loar Holdings delivers strong fundamental growth (Revenue and EBITDA growing ~20% CAGR) driven by successful M&A and pricing power, but this fundamental accretion is partially offset by valuation multiple compression. Investors paying ~41x EBITDA today are effectively "pulling forward" future returns. As the company scales, it will likely re-rate to a (still premium) 28x-30x multiple, resulting in a stock price that grinds higher rather than exploding upward.

**Bull-Case Multiplier: 1.8× – 2.1×** \
For the stock to double (~2.0×), Loar must defy gravity on valuation. The company must accelerate M&A volume significantly (utilizing its high stock price as currency to buy earnings accretively) _while_ the market refuses to compress the multiple below 35x-40x. This requires a "goldilocks" environment: falling interest rates, a booming aerospace cycle, and flawless integration of acquired targets. In this scenario, the market treats LOAR not as a hardware company, but as a compounding financial algorithm, maintaining the scarcity premium.

**Verdict: Unlikely** \
(Borderline in a raging bull market, but Unlikely in a conservative base case).

**Monitoring Metrics:** \
Organic Revenue Growth % (>8%); Adjusted EBITDA Margin % (>36%); Free Cash Flow Conversion % (>50%); Number of Acquisitions Closed (Target 2-4/yr); Net Leverage Ratio (&lt;4.0x); Book-to-Bill Ratio; Acquired EBITDA Multiple (&lt;12x); Interest Expense % of Revenue.
