REITs are companies that own, operate, or finance income-producing real estate. They often have particular ways of recognizing and presenting revenues and expenses, partly because their principal business is the ownership and management of real property and partly because they enjoy special tax treatment as long as they meet certain regulations (e.g., distributing a high portion of their taxable income as dividends). When examining the income statement of a REIT, one will find both traditional line items that appear in many corporate statements (such as “General and Administrative Expenses” or “Interest Expense”) and other items that are more specific to real estate companies (such as “Rental Income,” “Real Estate Taxes,” “Depreciation and Amortization of Real Estate Assets,” and “Property Operating Expenses”).

In addition, each REIT’s business model can influence how these line items appear. An industrial REIT like Modiv focuses on industrial properties, a manufactured housing and resort REIT like ELS focuses on rental income from communities and memberships, while a retail center REIT like Phillips Edison focuses on shopping centers anchored by grocery tenants. Because each REIT has a unique operational focus, the relative weight or nature of individual income-statement items may differ substantially.

The aim of this article is to walk through the most common line items typically found on [REIT](https://www.reit.com/) income statements, highlight specific examples drawn from these three REITs, and discuss which income statement might indicate a higher-quality operating performance (as opposed to simply a larger revenue base). Although the three REITs differ in size, we will concentrate here on how the items reflect the operational and accounting aspects of running a REIT, not the raw scale of operations.

### Income Statement
Here are the three REITs’ Income Statements as of September 30, 2024 that we will study:

## Common Income Statement Line Items in REITs

Below, we identify some of the most important and frequently encountered lines in a REIT’s income statement, then illustrate each item with references to how Modiv, ELS, or Phillips Edison discloses or presents it. These explanations also incorporate REIT-specific accounting considerations wherever relevant, including certain principles outlined under [GAAP](https://www.fasb.org/) and [ASC 842](https://asc.fasb.org/) for lease accounting.

### 1. Rental Income

#### General Meaning and REIT-Specific Aspects

“Rental income” is typically the primary revenue source for REITs because most REITs own a portfolio of real estate assets that generate revenue from tenant leases. REITs generally recognize rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, though certain REITs may have variable components—such as percentage rents in retail settings or short-term lease structures (like campground RV site rentals in the case of a resort/community REIT).

In many REITs, “Rental Income” can include not only base rent from leases but also tenant reimbursements for property-level expenses like real estate taxes, maintenance, and utilities if the lease structure allows for these pass-throughs.

- **Example from Modiv:** Modiv presents “Rental income” as one of its primary sources of revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Modiv reported rental income of approximately \$11.59 million. This figure arises primarily from leases across industrial properties that Modiv owns.

- **Example from ELS:** ELS discloses “Rental income” as well, showing roughly \$314.47 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. In ELS’s case, rental income often comes from site rentals for manufactured home communities, RV parks, and marina slips, reflecting the diversity of its portfolio.

- **Example from Phillips Edison:** Phillips Edison reports “Rental income” of about \$161.78 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which arises primarily from grocery-anchored shopping centers. The difference in how much each REIT collects in rental income depends not only on the size of its portfolio but also on the market rents, the lease structures, and the occupancy rates.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

While the basic [revenue recognition](https://www.fasb.org/revenue) guidelines apply, REITs often adhere to specialized guidance related to leases ([ASC 842](https://asc.fasb.org/)) and to intangible lease assets or liabilities recognized upon property acquisitions. For example, if a REIT purchases a property with in-place leases that are above or below market, GAAP requires the acquirer to record intangible assets or liabilities that are amortized over the remaining lease term, which can affect how net rental revenue is ultimately reported.

### 2. Other Property-Related Income (Including Management Fee Income)

#### General Meaning

In addition to rental income, some REITs may earn fees for property management services if they manage properties for third-party owners, or they may earn various forms of ancillary income. This line item is less universal than “Rental Income” but still appears frequently in REIT statements, particularly those that hold joint ventures or manage external portfolios.

- **Example from Modiv:** Modiv discloses “Management fee income” separately, reporting around \$65,993 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This is a relatively small revenue stream compared to the primary rental income, but it is notable as it illustrates that Modiv manages properties or assets for other investors.

- **Example from Phillips Edison:** Phillips Edison reports “Fees and management income” of about \$2.86 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This typically arises from property management services provided to real estate joint ventures or other third parties.

- **Example from ELS:** ELS does not have a dedicated line item simply called “Management fee income,” but it does disclose membership upgrade sales, annual membership subscriptions, and other such revenue streams, reflecting how it earns ancillary income in addition to traditional rent. ELS’s “Other income” in the same quarter was approximately \$16.44 million, which likely includes items beyond standard site rentals—such as commissions from home sales, utility rebilling, or other property-related fees.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

Fees for property management or other ancillary services are typically recognized when services are rendered and are subject to [revenue recognition rules](https://www.fasb.org/revenue). For membership-based services (as with ELS’s subscription structures), revenue recognition can have unique timing or deferral elements, since payment might be made up-front and recognized over the life of the membership.

### 3. Membership-Based Revenues or Annual Subscriptions (REIT-Specific)

#### General Meaning

Some specialized REITs (particularly those in the hospitality, resort, or campground niches) generate recurring revenues from membership subscriptions. For ELS, “Annual membership subscriptions” refer to fees paid by customers for the right to use certain campground or resort facilities over a designated time. This is a distinctive line item in ELS’s statement, not found in more traditional REITs like Modiv or Phillips Edison.

- **ELS Example:** ELS shows “Annual membership subscriptions” of about \$16.71 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. This complements rental income from the communities themselves and highlights how ELS leverages multiple revenue streams.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

Annual membership subscriptions usually must be deferred and recognized over the subscription period. If the membership covers, for instance, one year of usage rights, ELS would typically record the cash collected as deferred revenue and then systematically recognize it as “Annual membership subscriptions” income over the relevant months.

### 4. Gains (or Losses) on Sale/Impairment of Real Estate

#### General Meaning

REITs often acquire and dispose of properties to optimize their portfolios. When a property is sold, the difference between the net proceeds and its carrying amount is reported as “Gain (or Loss) on Sale of Real Estate.” Similarly, “Impairment” refers to write-downs when the carrying value of a property is determined not to be recoverable. Because REITs have large real estate holdings, these items can be quite material and can appear sporadically, depending on the transaction activity in a given period.

- **Modiv Example:** For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Modiv recognized a “Gain on sale of real estate investments, net” of about \$3.36 million, whereas in the same period for 2023, there was a loss of roughly \$1.71 million. This illustrates how dispositions can affect the bottom line from period to period.

- **ELS Example:** ELS reports a “Loss on sale of real estate and impairment, net” of approximately \$1.80 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Over time, this line can be positive or negative, reflecting specific property transactions.

- **Phillips Edison Example:** Phillips Edison shows a relatively small “(Loss) gain on disposal of property, net” of about \$-19,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, which is negligible relative to the total revenues. In prior periods, they have occasionally recognized gains, demonstrating how timing and property sale strategy greatly influence this item.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

Under [U.S. GAAP](https://www.fasb.org/), properties are recorded at depreciated cost. When a REIT decides to sell a property, it compares the carrying amount (original cost minus accumulated depreciation and any impairment taken in prior periods) to the net sales proceeds. If the proceeds exceed the carrying amount, the REIT has a gain; if not, it has a loss. Impairment charges occur when a property’s carrying amount can no longer be fully recovered based on expected future cash flows, and they reduce the asset’s carrying value on the balance sheet. Because real estate markets can fluctuate, impairment charges may arise when property values fall or significant tenant-related issues occur.

### 5. Property Operating Expenses

#### General Meaning

“Property operating expenses” refers to the direct operating costs of managing and maintaining the real estate portfolio, such as repairs and maintenance, utilities, property insurance, and onsite personnel or vendor costs. These costs exclude real estate taxes (often shown separately), depreciation, and amortization.

- **Modiv Example:** Modiv’s “Property expenses” totaled about \$1.03 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

- **ELS Example:** ELS calls this line item “Property operating and maintenance” expense and recorded about \$129.01 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

- **Phillips Edison Example:** Phillips Edison shows “Property operating” expense of approximately \$27.53 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Because ELS’s portfolio includes large communities, membership-based facilities, and other properties requiring potentially higher levels of direct operational oversight, it’s not surprising that its property operating expenses (in absolute dollars) are more substantial. However, to measure efficiency, investors often compare property operating expenses to rental income or net operating income to see how well a REIT manages controllable costs.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

Property operating expenses in many REITs can be partly or fully reimbursed by tenants, depending on lease structures (e.g., triple-net leases for industrial or net leases for shopping centers). In such cases, these reimbursements often end up in “Rental income” or a separate “Tenant reimbursements” line. The net effect is that the REIT may show high property operating expenses but also show a corresponding offsetting line in revenue.

### 6. Real Estate Taxes

#### General Meaning

Real estate taxes (property taxes) are often shown as a separate line item to highlight one of the largest expenses associated with real property ownership. Some REITs pass these expenses through to tenants, while others absorb them as part of a gross lease.

- **ELS Example:** ELS had “Real estate taxes” of about \$20.73 million for the third quarter of 2024, a distinct line item that can significantly impact overall operating results.

- **Phillips Edison Example:** Phillips Edison reported \$19.57 million of “Real estate taxes” in the same quarter.

- **Modiv Example:** Modiv tends to group real estate taxes into “Property expenses” or reports it in the footnotes. For many industrial properties structured with triple-net leases, tenants pay the taxes directly, effectively reimbursing the REIT. Where that is the case, the line might be smaller or simply included within “Property expenses.”

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

Real estate taxes are recognized as an expense in the period for which the taxes apply. Depending on local regulations, taxes may be paid annually, semi-annually, or quarterly, but [GAAP](https://www.fasb.org/) requires the expense to be spread over the relevant period. Net lease structures commonly reduce the net real estate tax burden for the REIT if tenants pay or reimburse these charges.

### 7. General and Administrative Expenses (G&A)

#### General Meaning

“General and Administrative” includes overhead costs not directly tied to operating the properties—such as executive salaries, corporate office expenses, legal and accounting fees, and other corporate-level costs. G&A can be an important line item for analyzing how efficiently a REIT’s management runs the business at the corporate level.

- **Modiv Example:** Modiv reports “General and administrative” expense of about \$1.66 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

- **ELS Example:** ELS shows \$9.27 million in “General and administrative” in the same quarter.

- **Phillips Edison Example:** Phillips Edison’s “General and administrative” is around \$11.11 million in the third quarter of 2024.

As with any corporate entity, G&A can fluctuate based on the size of the organization, how many properties are self-managed, and the complexity of the REIT’s transactions. From a quality standpoint, many investors look at G&A as a percentage of total revenue or total assets to judge how effectively the REIT manages overhead relative to its portfolio.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

While G&A is not unique to REITs, there can be certain REIT-specific considerations—like costs associated with compliance with [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/) rules for real estate offerings, investor relations for a large retail shareholder base, or specialized legal fees for property acquisitions. REITs often are quite transparent about which corporate overhead costs are included in G&A and which are allocated to property expenses.

### 8. Depreciation and Amortization

#### General Meaning

Real estate assets are recorded on the balance sheet and depreciated (for buildings) or amortized (for intangible lease assets) over their useful lives. In the U.S., commercial properties are often depreciated over 39 years (residential properties over 27.5 years). Lease intangibles discovered at acquisition (such as in-place leases, above/below-market leases, or tenant relationships) are also amortized over the expected benefit period. This line item is typically very large for REITs because they hold significant real property on their balance sheets.

- **Modiv Example:** “Depreciation and amortization” was around \$4.17 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, climbing to about \$12.44 million over nine months.

- **ELS Example:** ELS reported about \$50.93 million in “Depreciation and amortization” for the same quarter.

- **Phillips Edison Example:** Phillips Edison recorded roughly \$68.33 million in “Depreciation and amortization” for the third quarter of 2024.

Because depreciation is a major non-cash expense for real estate owners, many REITs utilize metrics like [Funds from Operations (FFO)](https://www.reit.com/investing/reit-basics/funds-operations) or Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) to adjust for these non-cash depreciation charges. GAAP net income can be significantly distorted by large depreciation charges even if the actual economic value of the real estate is stable or rising over time.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

Unlike many non-real estate operating companies, REITs must depreciate land improvements (buildings) over fairly long periods despite the fact that real estate values do not necessarily diminish in a straight line. The intangible components, such as tenant relationships and above/below market leases, also come into play. Hence, analysts pay particular attention to FFO, AFFO, or Core FFO as supplemental, non-GAAP performance measures for REITs.

### 9. Impairment of Real Estate Investment Property

#### General Meaning

When there is a significant decline in the utility or fair value of a real estate asset such that the carrying amount is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. Impairment can result from many factors: tenant bankruptcies that reduce expected rental income, changes in local real estate markets, or strategic decisions to dispose of an underperforming asset.

- **Modiv Example:** In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Modiv recognized about \$3.50 million in impairment of real estate investment property (none in 2024).

- **ELS Example:** ELS lumps this with “Loss on sale of real estate and impairment, net,” making it sometimes unclear whether the line is purely impairment or includes realized losses on sales.

- **Phillips Edison Example:** Phillips Edison does not show a specific impairment line item in the excerpt for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, though it may have had it in prior periods if it recognized an impairment.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

Impairment is a key issue for real estate. Once taken, it cannot be reversed under [U.S. GAAP](https://www.fasb.org/). Investors usually track whether a REIT frequently takes large impairments, as that might indicate overpayment for assets or weaknesses in underwriting or property management.

### 10. Operating Income (or Operating Loss)

#### General Meaning

Operating income is calculated as total revenues less total operating expenses. It excludes interest, taxes, and other non-operating items. It is an indicator of the core profitability of the REIT’s property portfolio and operations before considering capital structure (interest expense) or unusual items.

- **Modiv Example:** For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Modiv reported operating income of about \$4.90 million (compared to an operating loss in the same period of the prior year, largely impacted by high stock compensation expense in 2023).

- **ELS Example:** ELS shows “Income before income taxes and other items” of around \$82.79 million for the third quarter of 2024, which is effectively its measure of operating income minus items listed below that line (e.g., interest and early debt retirement).

- **Phillips Edison Example:** Phillips Edison’s operating income can be derived from total revenues (\$165.53 million) less total operating expenses (\$126.54 million), giving about \$38.99 million in the third quarter of 2024, though the statement does not explicitly label it “operating income.” After that, non-operating items like interest expense are subtracted to get net income.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

Because REITs must pay out the majority of taxable earnings as dividends, operating income is crucial to sustaining distributions. However, a single quarter’s operating income may be impacted by property dispositions, lease renewals, or one-off expenses.

### 11. Other Income and Expenses (Including Interest Expense, Interest Income, and Derivative Gains/Losses)

#### General Meaning

Below the operating income line, REITs record other income and expenses. This commonly includes:

- **Interest Expense:** The cost of debt financing. REITs are typically leveraged, so interest expense can be substantial.
- **Interest Income:** Typically modest amounts from cash balances or short-term investments.
- **Unrealized Gains or Losses on Derivatives:** Many REITs hedge their exposure to rising interest rates by using interest rate swaps or other derivatives, whose fair value fluctuations can be recognized in earnings.
- **Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:** If a REIT holds a stake in a property via a joint venture not consolidated on the balance sheet, it recognizes its share of that JV’s income or loss here.

- **Modiv Example:** Modiv’s interest expense was about \$6.10 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by roughly \$81,622 of interest income. Changes in the fair value of certain stock or derivatives also appear in this line.

- **ELS Example:** ELS listed about \$36.50 million as “Interest and related amortization” for the third quarter of 2024, and it separately includes “Interest income” of about \$2.43 million and “Income from other investments, net” of around \$2.19 million.

- **Phillips Edison Example:** Phillips Edison’s interest expense, net, was roughly \$25.00 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Because interest rates have risen in recent periods, it is not surprising that many REITs are dealing with increased interest expense on variable-rate debt or new debt issuances.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

The large volumes of real estate debt mean that interest expense is often a big factor in determining net income. Also, REITs typically use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk, so unrealized gains or losses from these swaps may appear in this section.

### 12. Net Income (Loss)

#### General Meaning

After deducting non-operating items, the REIT discloses its net income (or net loss). This figure is used for EPS (earnings per share) calculations. However, net income for REITs can be heavily influenced by non-cash depreciation, property sales, and impairments, so many investors prefer [FFO](https://www.reit.com/investing/reit-basics/funds-operations) and AFFO to evaluate ongoing, distributable cash flow.

- **Modiv Example:** Modiv posted a net loss of about \$1.05 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, but a net income of about \$4.85 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting variability from quarter to quarter depending on property sale gains and interest expenses.

- **ELS Example:** ELS had consolidated net income of about \$86.86 million for the third quarter of 2024, a robust figure, partly because it has a large and stable portfolio of manufactured home communities and RV resorts with stable occupancy and strong rent growth.

- **Phillips Edison Example:** Phillips Edison’s net income was about \$12.90 million for the third quarter of 2024, reflecting results from its shopping center portfolio.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

Because net income includes depreciation expenses and gains or losses on sales, it does not necessarily represent the “true” operating cash flows available for distribution. REIT analysts look at the quality of this net income figure by breaking out recurring (i.e., rental and property-level) income versus one-time items.

### 13. Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders and Earnings Per Share

#### General Meaning

REITs may have multiple classes of equity—common shares, preferred shares, OP units ([Operating Partnership Units](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/op-unit.asp)), and so forth. The line item “Net income attributable to common shareholders” is net of any allocation to preferred stock dividends or noncontrolling interests. This is the basis for “Earnings per Share (EPS).” For REITs, you often see them deducting preferred dividends to arrive at net income for common shareholders.

- **Modiv Example:** Modiv first calculates net income (loss), then subtracts any net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership, and then subtracts preferred stock dividends to arrive at the “Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders,” which was about \$-1.51 million in the third quarter of 2024.

- **ELS Example:** ELS shows “Net income available for Common Stockholders” after subtracting allocations to noncontrolling interest—such as common OP units—and any preferred stock dividends. ELS’s net income available for common stockholders was around \$82.82 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

- **Phillips Edison Example:** Phillips Edison had “Net income attributable to stockholders” of about \$11.60 million for the third quarter of 2024. Its basic and diluted EPS was \$0.09 per share for the same period.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

REIT capital structures frequently include operating partnership units, particularly in “UPREIT” structures, which can be exchangeable for common shares. The presence of these OP units often leads to additional lines for “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” and more complicated share counts for diluted EPS.

### 14. Preferred Dividends

#### General Meaning

Many REITs raise capital by issuing preferred shares in addition to common shares. Preferred shares generally pay a fixed dividend and have priority over common shares in distributions and liquidation. On the income statement, you typically see a line for “Preferred stock dividends” that is subtracted from net income to determine how much is left for common shareholders.

- **Modiv Example:** Modiv reports “Preferred stock dividends” of \$921,875 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Subtracting these from net income was necessary to arrive at the net income (loss) allocated to common shareholders.

- **ELS Example:** ELS occasionally has “Redeemable perpetual preferred stock dividends” as a separate line, though it may be minimal or zero if no preferred shares are outstanding or if those shares were redeemed.

- **Phillips Edison Example:** Phillips Edison’s excerpt for the period does not show a preferred dividend line, implying that it may not have outstanding preferred stock or has minimal amounts not disclosed in the main table.

#### REIT-Specific Accounting

Preferred dividends are recognized in the period they relate to and reduce the amount available for common shareholders. For distribution coverage analysis, analysts ensure that total dividends (common plus preferred) are supportable by the REIT’s cash flow metrics (e.g., [AFFO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affo.asp)).

### 15. Weighted-Average Shares and Net Income Per Share

This standard disclosure provides the average number of shares outstanding over the period. Diluted shares often factor in convertible securities or OP units. EPS for REITs is calculated consistent with [GAAP](https://www.fasb.org/) guidelines, but again, it is less commonly used by analysts relative to FFO-based metrics.



## Detailed Comparison of the Three REITs

Now, let us compare Modiv, ELS, and Phillips Edison with respect to the major components of their income statements. The focus is not on absolute magnitude (since these three REITs differ greatly in size and portfolio composition), but rather on the general quality and consistency of their income-generating activities and expense management.

1. **Revenue Composition and Diversity**
   - **Modiv:** Primarily earns from industrial rental properties, with a smaller management fee income stream. The steadiness of rental revenue depends on relatively longer-term industrial leases, often [triple-net leases](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netlease.asp).
   - **ELS:** Highly diversified with rental income from manufactured home communities, RV resorts, marina slips, plus unique revenue streams from “Membership subscriptions” and “Membership upgrade sales.” This revenue model provides both stable recurring income (long-term site rentals) and recurring membership fees, which can somewhat reduce exposure to cyclical swings in the broader economy.
   - **Phillips Edison:** Concentrates on grocery-anchored retail centers. Rental income is usually stable if anchor tenants are well-established grocery operators, supplemented by smaller inline retail tenants. Some fees and management income from joint ventures appear, but the bulk remains the standard base rent plus tenant reimbursements typical in shopping-center REITs.

2. **Operating Expenses and Control**
   - **Modiv:** Shows relatively modest property expenses, partly because many of its leases are structured to pass costs to the tenant. Its triple-net model means that the majority of property-level costs (taxes, maintenance) might be reimbursed.
   - **ELS:** Has high property operating and maintenance expenses in absolute terms, but that is expected given the scale of its communities, where ELS often handles on-site amenities, landscaping, community improvements, and hospitality functions.
   - **Phillips Edison:** Also has meaningful property operating expenses, though many are offset by tenant reimbursements. The property operating costs are typical of a retail REIT that manages common area maintenance (CAM), repairs, and other upkeep for shopping centers.

3. **Management of Debt and Interest Expense**
   - **Modiv:** Interest expense has increased from prior periods because of new debt or rising interest rates. This has a significant effect on net income, but the REIT also benefited from some property sales that led to gains.
   - **ELS:** Has substantial interest expense due to its larger portfolio, but it also has diversified revenue sources and stable occupancy, so it can generally manage these financing costs.
   - **Phillips Edison:** Shows interest expense as one of the bigger line items below operating income. The net interest expense of about \$25 million in the third quarter of 2024 reflects the cost of financing a large retail property portfolio.

4. **Bottom Line and Consistency of Results**
   - **Modiv:** Fluctuations in net income from quarter to quarter have been pronounced because of dispositions, impairment charges in prior periods, and changes in stock compensation expenses. However, the shift to net income in 2024 for the nine-month period suggests improved operating results after some one-time items in 2023.
   - **ELS:** Has a larger and more established portfolio that delivers substantial net income, showing better stability across quarters. ELS also has unique membership-related revenue that can enhance revenue diversity.
   - **Phillips Edison:** Consistently profitable. Although the net income is lower than that of ELS in absolute terms, it remains stable quarter to quarter. Gains or losses on property sales are typically modest.

From a quality perspective—meaning consistency of income, diversification of revenue streams, and more predictable expenses—**ELS** stands out because of its robust net income, diversified revenue sources, and relatively stable margins. **Phillips Edison** also appears healthy, with consistent net income from a fairly recession-resistant grocery-anchored asset base. **Modiv**, while smaller, has improved results over time and uses a triple-net model, which can be stable but also lead to volatility if it disposes of properties or experiences changes with key tenants.

Therefore, if one were to pick which income statement “looks better,” ignoring scale and focusing on consistency, diversity of income, and operational quality, an argument could be made in favor of ELS. It shows strong net income, has multiple revenue streams (rent plus memberships and upgrades), and while it does have sizable property operating expenses, these are offset by robust revenue generation. At the same time, Phillips Edison is not far behind in terms of consistent performance, given the reliability of grocery-anchored assets. Modiv, although smaller, can show strong results if it successfully manages its triple-net industrial properties. The real issue for Modiv is that one-time items such as gains on sale or impairments can swing reported net income more dramatically in a given quarter.



## Final Notes

A REIT income statement contains numerous line items that each convey crucial insights into how the company generates and spends its funds. Rental income is the most recognizable revenue item, particularly for real estate owners. Other property-related income, such as fees and management income, may be additional sources of revenue, while specialized REITs like ELS benefit from alternative income streams like annual subscriptions or membership sales.

On the expense side, property operating expenses, real estate taxes, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation/amortization represent the main cost categories. Since real estate is a capital-intensive business, the combination of property-level expenses and corporate overhead can be substantial. Meanwhile, large non-cash charges like depreciation can heavily reduce GAAP net income, which is why alternative metrics like FFO and AFFO are widely used.

Looking at the three REITs analyzed—Modiv, ELS, and Phillips Edison—we observe that ELS boasts strong revenue diversity and stable net income, making its income statement quite robust when judged by consistency and breadth of revenue streams. Phillips Edison’s retail portfolio anchored by grocery tenants helps it remain relatively steady, too, while Modiv’s results have historically been more susceptible to short-term swings from property transactions and certain large one-time expenses. Each REIT’s income statement underscores how the nature of its portfolio (industrial properties, manufactured home communities, or grocery-anchored shopping centers) drives the structure of its revenues, expenses, and ultimately, its net income.

By focusing on the qualitative aspects—like how predictable and diverse revenues are, how effectively the REIT controls property-level and corporate costs, and whether it manages its interest expense—investors can glean which REIT has the stronger operational footing. Even if a smaller REIT like Modiv does not generate as much absolute revenue as ELS or Phillips Edison, it can still present a “high-quality” income statement if it displays consistent rent collections, stable occupancy, and efficient expense management. Hence, size alone should never be the deciding factor; rather, it is the quality and sustainability of earnings, the transparency of line-item reporting, and the REIT’s capacity to handle market shifts that ultimately define a healthy REIT income statement.
