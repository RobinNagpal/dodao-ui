Owens-Illinois reported similar polymer cost hikes that increased production costs for PET bottles. Continued volatility undermines forecasting and drives cyclicality in the rigid container segment.",
      "Escalating trade tariffs: The US imposed a 25% tariff on plastic imports from Mexico effective April 2025, as per [Plastics Industry Association](https://www.plasticsindustry.org), raising import costs for Owens-Illinois' PET preforms. China-bound imports now face a cumulative 54% tariff, squeezing profit margins for Berry Global's imported closures and specialty bottles. These tariffs disrupt established supply chains and force shifts to more expensive domestic sourcing. Uncertainty over retaliatory measures adds risk to future cost planning.",

Berry Global's new Ohio facility still faces inbound container delays, impacting just-in-time supply to food and beverage customers. Owens-Illinois noted a `12%` increase in logistics expenses due to shipment reroutes and air freight surcharges. Persistent disruptions lead to higher safety stock and increased working capital requirements.",
      "Competition from alternative packaging: Brands are shifting to refillable glass and aluminum formats to meet sustainability goals, reducing demand for single-use plastic jars and bottles. L'Oreal's move to refillable `aluminum + glass` compacts in its skincare line cut Berry Global's rigid jar volumes by `5%` in 2024. Smaller start‑ups offering paper‑based tubs further encroach on Berry's market share in premium packaging. The drift toward reusable and non-plastic alternatives pressures pricing and volume growth in the rigid container segment."

  "tariffImpactSummary": "### Positive Impact\n1. **Berry Global (BERY)** leads the domestic winners with a `1.5%` EBITDA margin boost due to reshoring and tariff insulation on `25–54%` duties on imports (source: [Plastics Industry Association](https://www.plasticsindustry.org)).  \n2. **Owens‑Illinois (OI)** benefits from US expansions, adding `50M` annual bottle capacity and capturing nearshore glass orders (source: [OI Sustainability Report Q1 2025](https://www.oisustainability.com)).  \n3. **Silgan Holdings (SLGN)** projects `5–7%` top‑line growth on in‑region plastic and metal container supply.  \n4. Domestic resin suppliers like **Dow** and **ExxonMobil** see `4–6%` revenue uplift as feedstock demand shifts.  \n5. US molding equipment OEMs forecast `8–12%` order growth amid capacity builds (source: [Berry Global Press Release](https://www.berryglobal.com/news)).  \n6. E‑commerce packaging volume rose `18%` in 2024, driving ultra‑light rigid container demand (source: [eMarketer](https://www.emarketer.com)).  \n7. PCR mandates (`20–30%` by 2025) bolster demand for sustainable resins (source: [EPA](https://www.epa.gov)).\n\n### Negative Impact\n1. US converters relying on imported rigid containers such as **Pactiv Evergreen (PTVE)** and **Karat Packaging (KRT)** face `3–5%` revenue declines and `50–80bps` margin squeeze (source: [Plastics Industry Association](https://www.plasticsindustry.org)).  \n2. Food & beverage firms importing bottles, e.g., PepsiCo and Nestlé, incur `2–4%` higher packaging costs under `25%` Mexican tariffs.  \n3. US exporters to Canada and Mexico risk `6–9%` export revenue loss from retaliatory tariffs (source: [USMCA Retaliations Overview](https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement)).  \n4. Raw material inflation (HDPE/PP up `15%` YTD) disrupts margins (source: [S&P Global Platts](https://www.spglobal.com/platts)).  \n5. Logistics bottlenecks (+5 days lead time) raise working capital needs (source: [Journal of Commerce](https://www.joc.com)).  \n6. Single‑use plastics regulations require `€50M` capex to retrofit lines (source: [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/plastics/single-use-plastics_en)).\n\n### Final Notes\n1. The sector remains resilient as domestic reshoring and sustainability mandates offset tariff headwinds.  \n2. Integrated players (Berry, Silgan) and recyclers (O‑I) sustain mid‑single‑digit EBITDA growth through cost control and PCR investments.  \n3. Challengers like Ranpak gain share with paper‑based solutions as plastic tariffs raise import costs.  \n4. Tariffs drive US capacity investments, benefiting equipment OEMs and resin makers, while penalizing import‑dependent converters.  \n5. Ongoing resin price volatility and trade policy uncertainty underline the need for diversified sourcing.  \n6. Investors can expect low‑to‑mid single digit revenue growth and modest margin expansion over 12–18 months."
