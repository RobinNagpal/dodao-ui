      "Feedstock price volatility and energy costs\nPolyethylene and polypropylene spot prices spiked nearly `30%` in late 2024, lifting input costs for Amcor’s barrier films and Sealed Air’s Cryovac multilayer pouches.  \nPower-intensive extrusion and lamination lines further inflate operating expenses.  \nWith limited ability to pass on costs in a competitive market, margins are squeezed across the sector.",
      "Regulatory and sustainability pressures\nBans on certain multilayer films in the EU and U.S. states force re‑engineering of Sealed Air’s high‑barrier MAP (Modified Atmosphere Packaging) pouches and Amcor’s lidding films.  \nCompliance with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes raises reformulation and labeling costs.  \nR&D outlays climb as producers work to develop recyclable mono‑material films.",
      "Tariffs and trade disruptions\nNew U.S. tariffs (25% on Mexico/Canada, 54% on China) drive up import costs for Sealed Air’s Mexican‑made bubble wrap and Amcor’s Asia‑sourced sealant films.  \nSupply chains face uncertainty as companies reroute volumes to avoid duties.  \nHigher landed costs undermine competitive positioning in North American markets.",
      "Competition from alternative materials\nPaper‑based and compostable films from converters like Mondi and innovative start‑ups encroach on single‑use segment share.  \nAmcor’s conventional PE stand‑up pouches and Sealed Air’s shrink films face pricing pressure vs. bio‑resins.  \nBrands seeking green credentials may shift spend away from traditional flexible films.",
      "High capital intensity and recycling infrastructure gaps\nInvestments exceeding `$100 million` in advanced recycling units are required to meet rising PCR (post‑consumer resin) targets.  \nLong payback periods deter smaller converters from retrofitting lines.  \nInsufficient collection and sorting infrastructure limits access to feedstock for circular economy initiatives."

      "E‑commerce boom fuels lightweight film demand\nGlobal e‑commerce volumes grew >15% in 2024, driving need for protective films like Sealed Air’s Bubble Wrap Ultra and Amcor’s Flexi‑Shield mailer pouches.  \nLightweight flexible formats reduce shipping costs and carbon footprints.  \nRetailers continue to favor films over rigid containers for last‑mile packaging.",
      "Circular economy and mono‑material innovation\nBrands increasingly mandate recyclable mono‑polymer structures—Amcor’s AmPrima PE film now offers up to `40%` recycled content.  \nSealed Air has commercialized mono‑PET shrink films that simplify end‑of‑life sorting.  \nThese innovations open new growth avenues under sustainability pledges.",
      "Rising demand for fresh and convenience foods\nConsumer preference for on‑the‑go and ready‑to‑cook meals lifts volumes of high‑barrier stand‑up pouches and lidding films.  \nSealed Air’s MAP solutions and Amcor’s metal‑detectable bakery films see double‑digit sales growth.  \nLonger shelf life and reduced food waste strengthen value proposition.",
      "Advanced barrier and high‑performance film R&D\nNext‑gen barrier technologies—such as Amcor’s graphene‑infused PET laminates—extend product shelf life by up to `50%`.  \nSealed Air’s active packaging films integrate moisture absorbers and antimicrobial agents.  \nPremium structures command higher ASPs (average selling prices) and improve margins.",
      "Emerging markets expansion\nRapid urbanization in Asia‑Pacific and Latin America underpins strong volume growth for flexible films.  \nAmcor and Sealed Air are adding lines in India and Brazil to serve rising demand for consumer and e‑commerce packaging.  \nLocal production reduces exposure to tariffs and strengthens customer ties."
