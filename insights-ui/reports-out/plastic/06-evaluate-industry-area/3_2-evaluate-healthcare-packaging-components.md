Mexican component suppliers to the U.S. (e.g., Stevanato’s Tijuana lines) have trimmed exports by **20–25%** under the `25%` U.S. duty, straining CMO supply chains ([Stevanato Q4 2024](https://www.stevanatogroup.com/en/investors)). New entrants like ApiJect are also affected, with Canadian and Mexican resin tariffs widening injector unit costs by **12%**, compressing gross margins by ~300 bps. These tariff pressures, combined with `30%` feedstock volatility in 2023 ([S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/)), contribute to an aggregate **2% EBITDA drag** among import‑reliant operators. ## Final Notes on Sector Dynamics Overall, U.S. healthcare packaging and components firms are navigating a dual landscape of **tariff‑driven reshoring** and **regulatory investments**—for instance, West and Aptar each plan `>\$20M` in UDI serialization upgrades ([FDA UDI Guidance](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/unique-device-identification-system-udi)). While established players leverage their integrated footprints to absorb an estimated `\$25M` annual tariff burden, challengers such as UFP and ApiJect must pivot supply‑chain strategies to sustain nearshoring momentum. Investors should monitor upcoming tariff negotiations and cold‑chain regulations (e.g., USP <800>) as catalysts for further domestic capacity build‑out. With the global healthcare packaging market poised to reach `\$69.7B` by 2030 at an **8% CAGR** ([Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/healthcare-packaging-market-report)), companies that combine scale, vertical integration, and agile polymer sourcing are best positioned to capture long‑term value.
