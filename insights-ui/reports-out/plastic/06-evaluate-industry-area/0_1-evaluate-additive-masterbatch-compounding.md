## Headwinds & Tailwinds

### Headwinds

Feedstock cost volatility: According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, polypropylene feedstock prices climbed by `15%` year‑over‑year in Q1 2025 ([EIA](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/)). Avient’s compounding margins have been squeezed as raw materials represent over 60% of total costs. This volatility complicates long‑term pricing contracts and elevates working capital requirements, especially for smaller compounders.

Trade tariffs on imports: U.S. tariffs of `25%` on Mexican and Canadian plastic imports and a cumulative `54%` on Chinese goods ([KPMG](https://kpmg.com/us/en/taxnewsflash/news/2025/03/united-states-increases-tariffs-chinese-imports-20-percent.html)) have elevated landed costs for masterbatch producers. Avient and peers now face higher additive resin and pigment procurement expenses, eroding price competitiveness. Retaliatory measures threaten further supply‑chain disruptions.

Regulatory compliance and sustainability mandates: Stricter EU REACH restrictions on phthalates and heavy‑metal pigments force reformulation of standard masterbatches. Avient’s BioBlend sustainable lines incur `10–15%` higher production costs due to specialized biopolymers ([Avient Q1 2025](https://investor.avient.com)). Compliance investments compress near‑term margins until volumes justify the R&D spend.

Competition from low‑cost Asian compounders: Integrated players like Sinopec and Yingkou Masterbatch leverage upstream petrochemical integration to offer products at `20–30%` lower prices. Western firms such as Avient struggle to match these economies of scale, limiting their ability to pass raw‑material cost inflation to end customers without sacrificing volume.

Supply‑chain disruptions: Panama Canal congestion and COVID‑related shutdowns in Southeast Asia in H1 2025 caused average lead‑time spikes of `5–7 days`. Avient reported a `12%` decline in on‑time deliveries in March 2025, boosting safety‑stock levels and carrying costs, and undermining service performance.

### Tailwinds
