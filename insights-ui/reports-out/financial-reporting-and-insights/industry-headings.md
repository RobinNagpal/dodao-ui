# Financial Reporting and Insights Areas

## Retail Investment Insights
Focused on individual investors, this area covers consumer‑facing platforms that translate complex market data into actionable stock, alternative asset and real estate insights. It excludes generic accounting or real‑time data APIs, instead emphasizing curated research, thematic dashboards and crowd‑sourced signals. The three subareas target equity analysis, non‑public alternatives and real estate/REIT intelligence. Each service layer sits atop raw data, offering a pure insight experience rather than execution or portfolio accounting.

### Stock & Equity Analysis Apps
Tools designed for retail investors to dissect company fundamentals, earnings forecasts, valuation metrics and event‑driven signals. They blend quantitative research, crowd‑sourced sentiment and expert commentary. These apps avoid real‑time trading APIs and focus strictly on insight delivery.

Platforms provide credit research, private deal flow mapping and high‑touch wealth insights. They exclude accounting, ETL or real‑time data delivery, centering purely on research and signal generation.

## Advanced Analytics & Insights Platforms
Midstream solutions that power analytical workflows for professional investors. They stop short of wholesale data integration or real‑time APIs, instead offering modular tools for factor research, risk simulation and ESG analysis across asset classes. These platforms serve purely as decision‑support layers rather than trading or data‑warehousing engines.
