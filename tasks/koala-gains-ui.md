# UI Improvements

- [ ] Use a better color for 'See More / See Full Report' text
- [ ] For criterion reports, we are presenting information(data) but no analysis or insights



## Homepage
- [ ] Lower the navbar
- [ ] make 'Log in' a proper working button
- [ ] Instead of 'CrowdFunding Reports', it should be just 'CrowdFunding' as the other heading is just 'Reits'
- [ ] Add 'Blog' in navbar

## Custom reports page
- [ ] Replace 'See More' with 'See All Reports'
- [ ] Reduce text present below Crowdfunding
- [ ] Why there is 'Specific' in reits heading, remove it and 'REITS' should be 'REITs'

## Crowdfunding page

- [ ] Look and feel of the cards can be improved
- [ ] Replace 'A list of all the projects' with something better
- [ ] Replace 'This is a Crowdfunding project' on the card with something better and related to the project

### Crowdfunding detail page
- [ ] Dont show 'Additional Links' if its empty
- [ ] Make the report sections as cards

### Crowdfunding report detail page
- [ ] Add a heading for performance checklist items
- [ ] Clicking the performance checklist item should scroll to the relevant section
- [ ] Founder and Team -> Cross check the results cause person exists but report says 'Could not find LinkedIn profile'
- [ ] Founder and Team -> Profile images can be better placed, for now it all looks like a mess


## Reits page
- [ ] On the custom page, we are redirecting from 'Specific REITS Reports' but here on this page we are showing sector and industry group. As we are redirecting for reits, its self-explanatory that tickers will be of reits only
- [ ] show full company name instead of just the ticker
- [ ] View SEC Filing is crashing the application to some server error


### Reits report detail page
- [ ] Share some info about the ticker just like we show startup info in crowdfunding case
- [ ] write full company name instead of just the ticker
- [ ] Criterion report page -> spider chart can be added alongside performance checklist as it will help in comparing the current criterion with others
- [ ] Debt report page -> pie chart doesnt appear on the first page load
- [ ] ffo report page ->  waterfall chart is giving error
