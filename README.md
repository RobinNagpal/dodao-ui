# dodao-ui

Welcome to the dodao-ui repository! This repository serves as a monorepo for our projects. We have made some significant changes to improve code organization and reusability.

# Contribution
So far only DoDAO has been working on the applications in this repository. We like the crypto movement and also
creation of tokens/points for the community and having people as partners. 

If you are not getting paid from DoDAO, and you want to contribute to this repository, you are most welcome for it. 

We will maintain a list of contributors and their contributions in the repository. After we have more than 3-4 contributors, 
we can create token/points for the contributors and share the revenue/profits with them.

There is a long way to go for this. But its important to have this structure in place.

Check the [Contributions.md](docs/Contributions.md) file for more details.
